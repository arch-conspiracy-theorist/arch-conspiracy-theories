	Davis promoted the ideal of a "raceless" society, based on his belief that race as a biological or social construct was illogical and a fallacy


not always consistent? didn't seem to contribute toward this ideal

	...August 25, 1949: How to Block Both

	...Billions poured down the rat-hole in China to aid the corrupt Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek could have completely eliminated the slums in a number of major American cities, not only providing decent housing but employment in the construction of this housing.

	Trade with Russia, Eastern. Europe and Liberated China should be demanded



	...September 22, 1949: Cold War In Church

	...The cold war policies of the bi-partisans, administered by their thought control police, are aimed against such Negroes as Paul Robeson, who think American democracy could learn about race relations from Russia, against such labor leaders as Harry Bridges who oppose Taft-Hartley and the imperialistic Marshall plan, and against such pastors as Dr. Melish, who believe the Soviet Union and the U. S. can live peacefully in the same world.



	...September 29, 1949: Challenge to the Church

	..."Whatever your differences and mine may be with Soviet Russia, we must recognize the difference between the Communist attack on religion and the fascist attack. The Communist attack is intellectual, philosophical, critical and harmless, practically speaking."



	...September 29, 1949: Atom Bombs and Peace

	I think we have reached the point where the big question, the key question, the question which the thought control boys have decided is the test for "loyalty," has become merely so much empty rhetoric.

	Specifically, I refer to the many variations of this basic question: "Would you fight for the United States in the event of a war with Russia?"

	I say this is so much rhetoric, so many wasted words, because if there is a war between America and the Soviet Union, I, for one, will take a last fond glance at this beautiful world of ours and prepare to bid it goodbye forever. Not even life in Timbuktu could survive World War III.

	This has been removed from the realm of speculation to the real­ity of grim fact with the recent and reluctant admission by President Truman that the Soviets have the atom bomb. This means, simply, that an A-bomb cannot be dropped on Moscow or Siberia without expecting a return of the compliment at Washington, D. C., or California.

	I phrase it this way because the only talk I have heard of using such bombs came from high officials of the American Legion, former U. S. ambassadors and other top-ranking politicians. If there has been similar talk in the Kremlin, our espionage agents have not mentioned it in the daily press. Instead, the men of Moscow speak of peace—something which is officially interpreted by the White House as a "Communist plot."



	...December 29, 1949: Davis New CIO Battle Lines

	...As long as Roosevelt was alive, there was room under the CIO roof for all three groups, while Murray charted a difficult course intended to hold the entire organization intact. But after the death of FDR, the ascendancy of Truman and the start of the "cold war" with its aid to imperialism and the hysteria built up against Russia and the Communists, the CIO changed politically. All-out support for Henry Wallace in 1944 changed to bitter enmity in 1948.

	...January 12, 1950: Africa is Next Door

	...The empires of Western Europe are fighting as never before to retain a stranglehold on Africa. It is essential for the success of any war with Russia. Yet freedom for Africa is vital to freedom for all Asia; England, France and The Netherlands can get the wealth and raw materials to carry on warfare against liberation of their Asiatic colonies as long as they can exploit Africa. American Big Business prospers by controlling the imperialist cliques of Western Europe; the Atlantic Pact throws our armed might behind the empires as they attempt to crush independence movements within the colonies. And all of this continuation of virtual slavery is justified under the guise of a holy war to contain "Russian communism."

	...At the same time, the fire of liberation burns brighter among Africans with each success of Asiatic people to obtain self-government—thus further indicating the real closeness of Asia and Africa. And England, France, Belgium and the others are worried. So they bring out the usual cry of communism—sometimes with unexpected results.

	For instance, the 2.000,000 whites who rule South Africa have 147 members of parliament but permit only three for the 8,000,000 Negroes—and these three must be white. Last year the Negroes elected two representatives. Both are Communists. According to the Rev. R. W. Stopford, an educational leader in Africa, the natives are attracted by the fact that Russia has virtually abolished illiteracy and has ended discrimination against [sic] colored peoples.



	...February 9: 1950: Onward with the Hydrogen Bomb

	...Temporarily balked but not defeated, our dividend diplomats, with the willing hands of President Truman, went into the crisis-making business. If Molotov coughed, it threatened our "security" in Iran. If Vishinsky laughed, we were "endangered" in Korea. By laying down the proper propaganda barrage, we were soon able to by-pass the United Nations and island-hop our way from the Truman Doctrine to Greece and Turkey to the Atlantic Pact. We manufacture crises so rapidly that a new one is shoved in front of us before we can examine yesterday's or the one rushed in this morning.

	We have done these things, we said, rattling our atom bombs, because we love peace.

	But we, too, love peace, said the men in the Kremlin. Your productive capacity was unscathed and came out of the war greater than ever before in the whole history of mankind. It will take us years to restore the losses sustained by Russian industry from the German blitz; Let's get together, talk this thing but and settle our differences amicably so that we can all go about the business of making the world safe forever from another war. Peace we want above all else, said Uncle Joe in messages to America.

	Real Peace Is "Expensive Luxury"

	While the hopes of our people rose at these words, our dividend diplomats recoiled in horror. If the ideological conflict between our side and the Soviets was brought to an end, what would happen to our giant corporations getting fat contracts to make materials of war and products for the anti-Communists of Europe? With no brink-of-war economy, how could General Motors make $600,000,000 in one year in the face of rising unemployment? What would our generals and admirals think? No, real peace is an expensive luxury that the big stockholders and professional soldiers can't afford.

	So, trembling with fear, our dividend diplomats told us that we cannot trust the Russians when they speak of peace.

	...Then one day President Truman announced that the Russians had the atomic bomb. Our dividend diplomats wrung their hands but the people breathed more easily. If both sides had it, the chances of a hot war were quite remote. Neither would start anything for fear of retaliation by the other. Maybe there would be peace at last.



	...May 18, 1950: Our New “Democratic” Partner

	I was brought up with a healthy respect for the word, democracy. And yet I have constantly found it used with the utmost cynicism on the home front; this loose usage has undoubtedly prepared the way for careless handling internationally.

	Thus we have the amazing spectacle of the foreign ministers of the United States, Great Britain and France formally, announcing that Western Germany is being brought in as a full fledged partner in the alliance of the "western democracies" against Russia.

	If there had been a sincere effort to democratize Western Germany, I would feel much better about it. But it is a known fact that many honest American officials have quit their posts in disgust over the way in which Western Germany is being handed back to the Nazis.



	...June 15, 1950: The Master Plot

	...The New York trials of the 11 Communist leaders, the Harry Bridges trial, the contempt action against the Hawaii 36 are but steps in a definite program which could mean jail within two years for those who dare to read progressive publications, and this includes the HONOLULU RECORD. The plotters are banking on the continued disinterest of the American public in their master drive to kill off all independent and progressive thought within our nation.

	It is a matter of public record that on Thursday, January 12, this year, one Raymond P. Whearty, acting assistant attorney general, revealed to the House Subcommittee on Appropriations that the Department of Justice is planning the arrest and trial of 21,105 persons who — now get this — appear to be acting in concert with Russian interests." This program, Whearty said, is expected to "come up about the fiscal year 1951."

	...To Get Non-Conformists

	"The bulk of the cases involve subversive activity as applied to individuals or organizations. By that I mean persons who are active members of the Communist party and similar organizations, or who appear to be acting in concert with Russian interests." 

	This should be plain enough for all to see. By the justice department's own admission, they are not after Communists only but anybody who happens to object to the policies at the moment of those in power. That would mean anybody who spoke for peace or who opposed the Atlantic Pact or who asked for a raise in pay. This could be interpreted as "appearing to act in concert with Russian interests." They plan to do this even without the passage of the Mundt-Ferguson bill.

	And if they can make charges stick against the 21,105 victims, then they will mop up on anybody else who has not been intimidated and who insists on the traditional right to express an opinion contrary to those sanctioned by the thought police. In other words, you! This timetable for American fascism can be destroyed if the people throw off their indifference and decide they will permit no further infringement upon their democratic rights as Americans. Let the people speak!

	April 6, 1950: Bridges Conviction

	I am not at all surprised at the conviction of Harry Bridges. Disappointed, yes, but not surprised. With the political atmosphere prevailing in my country today, I believe that President Truman or even Alfred Sloan of General Motors would be convicted of being Soviet spies if a way could be found to bring them to trial. And if Senator McCarthy keeps up his attacks, even that might happen.

	From the accounts in the local daily press, Judge Harris gave a surprisingly fair charge to the jury. In this, he partially redeemed himself for certain earlier tactics which put the whole defense in a bad light. But by the time the court charged the jury, the real damage had already been done. The one bright spot is that the jurors deliberated from Friday until Tuesday before reaching a verdict. Even the growing roar of the witch-hunters did not intimidate them into a speedy decision of guilt. In calmer times, I believe they would have freed Bridges



https://books.google.com/books?id=8TXhy5pl2A0C&pg=PA224
	In four different federal hearings, Bridges denied under oath that he wa a member of the CPUSA. In the files of the Comintern in Moscow, we found a list of CPUSA members elected to the Central Committee of the party in 1936; on that list is a Comrade Rossi, identified in an accompanying biography as the pseudonym of Harry Bridges.


https://books.google.com/books?id=IB_ShD9fTcsC&pg=PA47
	Another former Communist, Sam Diner, told the FBI that Eisler had acted in concert with Harry Bridges to stir up dock workers in the San Francisco strike of 1934 that paralyed the city.

	Soviet Spies Cast a Wide Net in S.F. / Decoded messages reveal activities of KGB in the '40s

	...The messages, distributed last week by the NSA's Center for Cryptologic History, were coded by Soviet agents and telegraphed from San Francisco, Mexico City, New York and Washington to Moscow and vice versa.

	...Among the illegal activities in the Bay Area that Soviet agents engaged in were kidnapping Russians hiding here and sending them back to the Soviet Union, where they faced certain death; receiving and assisting clandestine Russian agents with faked American identities; spying on American officials; and recruiting Communists in California for intelligence work.

	...Another local figure who appears in the telegraph traffic, although the reference is fragmentary and unclear, is Harry Bridges, the longtime pro-Soviet head of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.

	...By Frank Marshall Davis

	Since those smeared with the Red brush were accused of "taking orders from Moscow," I should explain my attitude toward Russia. It had shifted as time passed. Like most readers of the general press, I had been brainwashed for years after the Bolshevik revolution. These pathological screams of hate continued without letup, led by the Hearst press. But at some point, I began hearing about the official policies of the Soviet Union and its determination to stamp out discrimination. Knowing also that Russia had no colonies and was strongly opposed to the imperialism under which my black kinsmen lived in Africa, and that those American forces which most staunchly resisted our own demands for equality were the  most rabid foes of Russia, I concluded the Soviet Union held the same position internationally that blacks were in domestically.  ...Like the vast majority of Afro-Americans who thought about the issue, I considered Red Russia our friend.

	...And I had felt betrayed when Stalin signed that nonagression pact with Hitler. So the Russians were as hypocritical as the rest of the white world! I, and other suals I knew, felt we had been deserted by our only potential champion. But after all, since the Russians were white, what else could you really expect?

	Frankly, I was happy when Hitler attacked the Soviets. Now order had been restored, and again I could feel kinship with the sprawling Red nation.

	One of the most notorious Communist front groups ever was the American Peace Mobilization, created by the Soviet Comintern in concert with CPUSA, organized in the summer of 1940. Congress would rightly dub the American Peace Mobilization “one of the most seditious organizations which ever operated in the United States,” “one of the most notorious and blatantly Communist fronts ever organized in this country,” and an “instrument of the Communist Party line.”

	The group’s goal was to keep America from going to war against Hitler or even providing Lend-Lease to nations like Britain being savaged by Hitler. The group took this position because, at the time, Stalin’s USSR was allied with Hitler. It was the Soviet line, and the ringleaders of the group were pro-Soviet patriots.


any truth to this?

	One of the first examples I found of Frank Marshall Davis getting noticed by Congress was a 1944 Congressional report listing his involvement in the American Peace Mobilization. That same report also cited the involvement of a fellow Chicagoan named Robert Taylor. Taylor was the grandfather of Valerie Jarrett.

	Taylor also served with Davis on another communist front, the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee, whose members masqueraded as civil-rights crusading "progressives." The two served on the board together.

	Both Taylor and Davis would have frequently encountered another politically active Chicagoan, Vernon Jarrett. Vernon Jarrett and Frank Marshall Davis worked together on the small publicity team of the communist-controlled Packinghouse Workers Union, which Frank Marshall Davis publicly called for nationalizing. Vernon Jarrett would one day become Valerie Jarrett's father-in-law.

no shit!

	Maybe we ought to get more savvy about the Communists anyway. A social system that can mold Russia from a huge weakling in twenty-five years to what is today the strongest and most united nation in Europe, a people who has borne the full brunt of the terrible Nazi war machine and has flung it back, must have something, fundamentally sound.

	You have probably noticed here at home that practically every social advance made under the Roosevelt regime has been labeled “Red.” You may have noticed also that practically everybody who yells, “Communist” is him-self anti-Negro or anti-labor


http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/us/black-privilege/index.html
	...David Horowitz, author of the book, "Black Skin Privilege and the American Dream," says blacks are still more privileged, though they lag behind other racial groups in varying categories. It's not white privilege that's preventing them from doing better, he says; it's their behavior, such as their inability to build more intact families.

	"The fact that white people are better off is not a privilege; it's earned," says Horowitz, founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a think tank in Los Angeles created to combat "the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values."

	...It’s not too early to consider the fate of Japan after her defeat, and what- ever plans are made will have to be worked out with the full approval of China as well as Russia, her neighbors, if there’s going to be any kind of real peace. No Anglo-American alliance is going to go in and run Japan in utter disregard of the wishes of the Soviet Union and the Chinese nation without inviting eventual disaster.
