	After several years at Human Events, Kincaid joined Iran-Contra scandal figure Oliver North's Freedom Alliance foundation as a researcher and newsletter editor. He also worked for Citizens United, a right-wing organization responsible for the racially charged Willie Horton TV ads that helped sink 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.


did he know Oliver North? involved in campaign against Dukakis?

does anybody listen to this guy at all?



from 1983:


http://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/science/education-curriculum-addresses-fear-of-atom-war.html
	EDUCATION; CURRICULUM ADDRESSES FEAR OF ATOM WAR

	...What remains to be seen, however, is whether educators and parents see the unit as a balanced treatment or as propaganda intended to win the young for the cause of nuclear disarmament.

	Behind the unit's development are two organizations, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the National Education Association, both of which have taken firm stands in favor of a freeze on nuclear weapons.


	... But the curriculum unit could turn out to be highly controversial, coming as it does when Reagan Administration has portrayed advocates of a nuclear freeze as working against the national interest.

	Conservative Objections

	Human Events, a national conservative weekly published in Washington, has denounced the curriculum and impugned the intentions of the sponsors. Cliff Kincaid, an associate editor of Human Events, said ''It seemed designed to create a new generation of antinuclear activists.''

	Mr. Kincaid charged that among the dozens of resources cited in the curriculum guide for further study, ''not one could be regarded as solidly prodefense and almost are intricately bound up with the peace movement.''


here sounds like a foil

also cited him attacking Mark Foley for his pedophile scandal:


http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/us/03foley.html?mtrref=www.google.com

in these they don't seem to cite him as a foil, maybe to back up Foley "facing criticism from left and right"

https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/foley-fallout-the-speakers-fate/
	Now the Foley fallout has united both Republican voter groups in anger, just five weeks before midterm elections that will determine whether the party holds its House and Senate majorities.

    “It’s one of the worst congressional scandals ever. A top House Republican who denounced sex predators as ‘animals’ stands accused of acting like one,” Cliff Kincaid, editor of the conservative Accuracy in Media Report, wrote in an editorial circulated by the pro-Republican Web site GOPUSA.com. His headline reflected an ire that went beyond Mr. Foley to envelop other House Republicans who acknowledge they had heard complaints about Mr. Foley’s questionable contacts with a former page. “Who Protected the Perverted Congressman?” it read.

    Or, if you’re in Burlington, Vt., a municipal cable service offers the network to about 1,000 homes. Washington Cable, in the capital, reaches half that. Better options are YouTube or GlobeCast satellite distribution.

	These are slim pickings. Al Jazeera English is far more accessible in Israel. Allan Block, the chairman of Block Communications, which owns Buckeye, told me: “It’s a good channel. Sir David Frost and David Marash are not terrorists. The attempt to blackball it is neo-McCarthyism.”

	Block, like other cable providers, got protest letters from Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog. Cliff Kincaid, its editor, cites the case of Tayseer Allouni, a former Afghanistan correspondent jailed in Spain for Al Qaeda links. This is evidence, he suggests, that “cable providers shouldn’t give them access.”

	Most cable companies have bowed to the pressure while denying politics influenced their decisions. “It just comes down to channel capacity and other programming options,” Jenni Moyer, a Comcast spokeswoman, told me.

	Sure, Trump loves conspiracy theories. So do his foes.

	By Jesse Walker

	...But the biggest Trump conspiracy stories are the ones that call the candidate a tentacle of the Kremlin. Half a year ago, this idea was largely limited to the fringes, where it was flogged by folks like Cliff Kincaid, a conservative gadfly who posed such queries as “Is Trump a sleeper agent for Moscow?” The idea started percolating into the mainstream media over the summer. It picked up steam after WikiLeaks’ release of the Democratic National Committee’s emails, a data dump many blamed on Russian hackers.

	Tell Me, Comrade, When Did Russia Go Bad?

	Jesse Walker

	...If I'm pessimistic about Russian liberty, I'm relatively optimistic when it comes to Russia's place in the world order. Two years before I was born, the Soviet Union sent tanks to a city in the middle of Europe. Nowadays the big Russian foreign-policy crisis involves a dispute over the control of a majority-Russian enclave just over the country's border. While I don't for a moment defend Putin's actions in Crimea, I think I can safely say that in the grand arc of history, this is a better problem to have. And while I don't have sympathy for those Americans eager to thrust this country deeper into that dispute, I can see that they're spouting the frustrated rhetoric of a faction that knows it isn't setting policy.

	Dana Milbank: Romney’s encouragement of the Obama conspiracies

	By Dama Millbank

	...Sununu, like other prominent Republicans, is winking at those conservatives who continue to make the claim, often race-based, that President Obama is something un-American, something “other” than the rest of us. On Thursday, two days after Sununu’s attack, Romney himself said that Obama lacks “an understanding of what it is that makes America such a unique nation.”

	Sununu and Romney are legitimizing people such as Cliff Kincaid.



Millbank weird

	The lunacy began when Cliff Kincaid, a leader of Accuracy in Media, the group holding the gathering, suggested that the Obama administration is covering up events regarding Benghazi because the CIA operation there was secretly arming the enemy. “This administration has a policy of supporting al-Qaeda, the same people behind the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11,” he declared.

	DOBBS: ...More now on one of our earlier reports: the unprecedented attack on this nation's sovereignty, an assault that is deceptively called the Security and Prosperity Partnership. It aims to integrate the economies of Mexico, Canada, and the United States by the year 2010.

	You may be thinking, wait a minute, you didn't approve that. You would be right. No one else has either. Why is no one outside this broadcast reporting this in the mainstream media?

	A veteran journalist is asking the very same question. We asked Cliff Kincaid, editor of the "Accuracy in Media Report", to join us here tonight to discuss just exactly that.

	Cliff, good to have you here.

	CLIFF KINCAID, EDITOR, "ACCURACY IN MEDIA REPORT": Great to be with you, Lou.

	DOBBS: It is, I think -- it's clear that you're as astounded as I am and as my colleagues are that more people in the media are not focusing on this issue.

	KINCAID: I think the issue of sovereignty is, frankly, just not as sexy as a former "Playboy" Playmate, for example, or the latest missing person.

	DOBBS: Right.

	KINCAID: But it involves the future of our country.

	Lou, I have been here in Washington, D.C., for almost 30 years, and this story about the submersion of U.S. sovereignty to this emerging trilateral entity, the North American community, the North American union, whatever you want to call it, seems to be the story of our lifetimes. It is simply incredible.

	Adding insult to injury, Al Jazeera English is subsidized by American taxpayers.

	As Cliff Kincaid has reported, in the Washington, D.C. region MHz Networks, a division of Virginia’s Commonwealth Public Broadcasting Corp., takes in more than $2 million a year from federal and state governments. Out of that total, $1.4 million comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is funded through congressional appropriations.

	Kincaid calls the channel “Jihad TV” and “an enemy propaganda organ.”

	...Davis was indeed a black poet. His works included attacks on Christianity. One Davis poem referred to Christ irreverently as a “nigger.” Davis was himself an atheist.

	However, Davis was better known as a communist propagandist whose work for the Communist Party in Hawaii earned him surveillance by the FBI and placement on its “security index.” Davis was also a pornographer who engaged in bizarre sexual practices, even pedophilia.

	Needless to say, Obama’s willingness to identify “Frank” as Davis before this audience raises questions as to why “Frank” wasn’t identified by his full name—Frank Marshall Davis—in the book itself. Obama made references to “Frank” 22 times throughout his book. Paul Kengor notes that Obama’s audio version of Dreams from My Father omitted every reference to “Frank” that was in the book. Those omissions were clearly designed to keep people from asking questions about “Frank,” since Obama was considering a run for the presidency.

	THE RE-EDUCATION BRAINWASHING CAMPS WE CALL UNIVERSITIES

	By Cliff Kincaid

	...The taxpayers who pay the bill for these Marxist re-education camps we call colleges and universities have to revolt against the socialism that rules higher education in America. Sanders wants to perpetuate that mind-set because he knows that, under the guidance of faculty from sociology, women’s and queer studies, students are being mind-controlled and groomed for jobs that don’t exist. Hence, they become more cannon-fodder for the revolution.

	America's Survival: Is Accuracy In Media damaging the cause it purports to represent?

	It is customary for RT’s most enthusiastic critics to at least feign a veneer of objectivity. Even when foaming at the mouth to land a blow, they’ll dress it up as concern for something or other. Then there’s Cliff Kincaid. Kincaid doesn’t bother with such niceties.

	Kincaid is a regular guest on mainstream media, boasting appearances on the likes of Fox, CBS and CNN. Indeed, he's a former guest co-host of the latter's Crossfire. Kincaid is also a director at Accuracy in Media, an influential press watchdog, which when you break it down, essentially specializes in smears posing as serious analysis.

	Just Who Was the Russian Agent After All?

	By Cliff Kincaid

	Ever since President Trump’s missile strike on Syria on April 6, which angered Russia’s Vladimir Putin, The Washington Post has ever-so-subtly backed away from its robotic “Russian interference to help elect Trump” claims, asserted with absolute certainty. The Post now, on April 7, calls it the “alleged” Russian efforts to “interfere in the 2016 presidential race.” The Post no longer sounds so sure of itself and its anonymous anti-Trump intelligence agency sources.

	The U.S. strike on a Syrian air base not only demonstrates that Trump will take decisive action against a Russian client state, but that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, is the real Russian dupe


Kincaid tries to argue the Russians didn't help Trump?

	Why the CIA Wants to Destroy Flynn

	By Cliff Kincaid  /  AIM.org

	The media have figured out they can’t bring down or impeach President Trump. So they are targeting his Cabinet officials and top advisers one by one. In the case of Michael T. Flynn, the media think they have hit pay dirt. The Washington Post has led the charge, using top-secret surveillance intercepts of communications between Flynn and the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. It’s more evidence that the CIA, and perhaps the National Security Agency (NSA), are out to destroy Trump’s national security adviser.

	...As CIA director, Brennan told a congressional forum that even voting communist, as he once did, was not a bar to employment at the agency. 

	...In his new book, iWar: War and Peace in the Information Age, Bill Gertz explains how the CIA has become “politicized,” dominated by a “liberal culture,” and resistant to probes of communist moles within.
