	Burtsev warmly welcomed the February Revolution. After the July events, he became one of the skirmishers of the anti-Bolshevik campaign. Burtsev wrote about the Bolsheviks: "These are our former comrades. Now they, taking advantage of the critical situation in which the entire country is due to the war, are its enemies and, for the sake of the success of their doctrinaire and their demagoguery, decided to complete their tasks, at least for this it was necessary to stake the fate of the whole country. " He believed that in July, "Lenin and his comrades treated us no less than a good plague or cholera"

	When Kerensky was head of the Revolution, Burtzev led a furious attack against men like Verkhovsky, Kerensky's Minister of War. When Lenin became the leader of the Revolution he led an even more venemous attack against Lenin.

	In Paris, Burtzev, now BLINDED BY RAGE, an open champion of Kolchak and Denekin, assembles the literary material for the assault on Lenin. John Spargo enrolls in the mud-slinging brigade and is dully supplied with FACTS and DOCUMENTS.


Spargo is the guy who laid it on the Bolsheviks here:

Author of introduction some Soviet guy who was in with Lenin during revolution.

Not sure what he is talking about but maybe worth looking into.

Says Malinovsky reported some dirt on Lenin to Beletzky, who told this to Burtsev. Apparently this was published in an article by Spargo.


there is something off about Verkhovsky, according to taylor:

	There may be one man still alive who knows the whole story; the Russian assistant military attaché, Captain Alexander Werchovski, who replaced Artamanov during his absence. A friend of Werchovski, a Polish nobleman named Louis de Trydar-Burzynski, stated in his memoirs, published in Italy in 1926, that “the assassination [at Sarajevo] was perpetrated with the support of the Russian military attaché at Belgrade, Captain Werchovski...” Werchovski, he continued, “was later War Minister in the Kerensky government; he was a young man whom I had known very well for years, and he told me quite frankly the truth about the origins, preparations and execution of the plot.” Unfortunately, Werchovski, if he is living today, is not likely to tell any more about the case; when last heard of, he held a high command in the Red Army—a curious detail in itself.

according to this guy Burtev and Beletzky did talk a lot about the revolution

	...Monday Sth WiwnJ^rf 1917 

	...Dinner with Armand de Saint-Sauveur at Contant’s restaurant. 
He is very worried about die situation- The town is in a fever and 
trouble is expected tonight It is said that General Verkhovsky, who 
has left the War Ministry, is in agreement with the Bolsheviks and 
that he has gone to the Soviet headquarters in the Smolny Institute 
to take charge of the movement against Kerensky.

	Burtsev writes today in his newspaper Obshcheye 
Delo S4 

	“It may now be quite confidently affirmed that there was no 
Kornilov conspiracy! Actually there was something quite differ- 
ent: a compact between the government and General Kornilov to 
fight the Bolsheviks'. That which the government’s representatives 
were negotiating with General Kornilov — a fight against the Bol- 
sheviks — had been the cherished dream of representatives of var- 
ious parties, both democratic and socialist. Right down to that 
unhappy day of August 26, they all looked upon General Kornilov 
as their saviour from the impending Bolshevik menace.” 

	Not a “conspiracy,” but a “compact” — writes Burtsev 
in italics. 

	He is right. In this instance he is undoubtedly right. 
	A compact was concluded to organize a conspiracy 
against the Bolsheviks, that is, against the working 
class, against the revolutionary army and the peasantry. 
It was a compact for a conspiracy against the revolution ! 


Burtsev saying Kornilov working for Kerensky


	...Burtsev said recently in Obshcheye Delo that “there 
was no Kornilov conspiracy ,” that there was “only a 
compact ” between Kornilov and the Kerensky govern- 
ment to wipe out the Bolsheviks and the Soviets with 
a view to establishing a military dictatorship. In con- 
firmation of this, Burtsev publishes in Obshcheye Delo, 
No. 6, an “explanatory memorandum” of Kornilov’s, 
consisting of a number of documents which give the 
history of the conspiracy. The immediate object of Bur- 
tsev’s move is to create a favourable atmosphere for 
Kornilov and to enable him to escape trial. 


Stalin impugning sinister motives on Burtsev


	...We are far from inclined to consider Kornilov’s 
materials exhaustive. Apart from the fact that Korni- 
lov is trying to shield himself from the charge of treason, 
he omits to mention, for example, certain persons and 
organizations implicated in the conspiracy, in the first 
place, representatives of certain Embassies at General 
Headquarters who, on the evidence of witnesses, played 
a by no means secondary role. It should also be 
noted that Kornilov’s “explanatory memorandum” was 
police-edited by Burtsev, who deleted several, and 
probably very important, passages from it. Nevertheless, 
the “memorandum” is of great value as documentary 


Burtsev "police edited" Kornilov's "explanatory memorandum"? what does that mean?


same article:

https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1917/10/04-2.htm
	Who Were They ?

	Who were Kornilov's advisers and inspirers? To whom did he confide his conspiratorial designs in the first place?

	"I wanted," says Kornilov, "to invite M. Rodzyanko, Prince G. Lvov and P. Milyukov to participate in the discussion of the state of the country and the measures needed to save it and the army from complete collapse, and requests were wired to them to be at General Headquarters not later than August 29."

	Those were the principal advisers, on the admission of Kornilov himself.

	Nor is that all. Besides advisers and inspirers, Kornilov had major collaborators, in whom he placed his hopes, on whom he relied, and with whom he intended to carry out his plot.

	Listen to this:

	"A project for the constitution of a 'Council of National Defence' was drawn up, to consist of the Supreme Commander as Chairman and Kerensky as Vice Chairman, Savinkov, General Alexeyev, Admiral Kolchak and Filonenko. This Council of Defence was to exercise a collective dictatorship, since it was recognized that a one-man dictatorship would be undesirable. Other Ministers suggested were Messrs. Takhtamyshev, Tretyakov, Pokrovsky, Ignatyev, Aladin, Plekhanov, Lvov and Zavoiko."

	This was the sinister band of right honourable conspirators who inspired Kornilov and were inspired by him, who secretly confabulated with him behind the backs of the people and applauded him at the Moscow Conference. 


sounds like they wanted to use the affair to get rid of certain people?

Kornilov's insistence on "death penalty" seems to have been of propaganda value to Stalin

	...The Kerensky government not only knew of this diabolical plan, but itself took part in elaborating it, and, together with Kornilov, was preparing to carry it out.


So Stalin, along with Burtsev, says Kerensky was in with the plot for a coup against his government

Stalin makes it sound like a plan involving him to grab dictatorial power.

This doesn't really make sense though since the whole driving force behind the coup was Kerensky horribly mismanaging the army, and Kerensky iirc called on Bolsheviks for aid and armed them.

Did Burtsev, whatever he published, force their hand in going with this "Kerensky was in on it" line of propaganda?


	...The "Kornilov conspiracy" was a conspiracy of the imperialist bourgeoisie against the revolutionary classes of Russia, against the proletariat and the peasantry.

	The aim of the conspiracy was to crush the revolution and establish a dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie.

	There were divergencies among the plotters, but they were of a minor, quantitative order. 


doesn't seem very convincing...

wait actually now that I think about it I guess he was right lol

	" Past " - a monthly magazine on the history of the liberation movement in Russia, the first legal journal of such subjects in the country. He went to Petersburg in 1906-1907 and in 1917-1926. The circulation in 1907 is about 30 thousand copies. The journal was published under the editorship of Bogucharsky and Shchegolev with Burtsev's formal participation. The magazine was devoted to the history of the liberation movement in Russia. The journal's materials laid the foundation for the source base for studying the history of the revolutionary and social movement in Russia in the 19th century. Since November 2012, the publication of the continuation of the journal, the leaders Shishkin Vitaly and Vladimir Gryaznov is preparing. The journal will continue to cover revolutionary events in modern Russia.


It's a journal on the history of the revolution by both Shchegolev and Burtsev

	...In 1900-1904 abroad, in London, Paris and Geneva, VL Burtsev and L.E. Shishko were released 6 numbers of the collection "The Past". The materials published in them were devoted to the revolutionary movement of the 1860s and 1880s, and especially to the Narodnaya Volya . Much of the material was a reprint of old illegal literature, but there were also unreleased material, memories. After Burtsev returned to Russia in the autumn of 1905 and after an amnesty in January 1906, together with V. Ya. Bogucharsky and P. Ye. Schegolev, he founded the periodic journal "The Past" in Petersburg.

	The magazine was published monthly, with books in 20 printed sheets each. The publishing house and the editorial staff were successively located on Spasskaya Street (25), Znamenskaya Street (19), Liteiny Prospect (21).

	Were published valuable information about the processes of NG Chernyshevsky , MI Mikhailov , DI Pisarev and NA Serno-Solovyevich , as well as a number of memoirs of the Narodniks. The magazine was published in a large circulation (about 30 thousand copies). He was subjected to repression and on the 10th (22nd) book in 1907 was closed. In 1908, the magazine "Past years" was published instead of it, and Burtsev resumed the publication of the magazine in Paris - in 1908-1913, No. 7-15 was published. A prominent place in it was occupied by documents on the terrorist activities of the Socialist-Revolutionaries ; separate materials about the revolution of 1905-1907 , secret government documents, data on provocateurs were also published.

	From July 1917 in Petrograd, the publication of the magazine was resumed by the co-operative publishing association of the same name, which, in addition to 35 issues of the magazine (with a circulation of up to 6,000 copies), produced more than 50 books of historical and revolutionary themes based mainly on archival materials. The editors of the journal in 1917, in addition to Shchegolev and Burtsev, were V. V. Vodovozov and E. V. Tarle ; from 1918 - Schegolev. Much of the material was devoted to the revolutionary movement of the twentieth century. Many materials were not missed by the Soviet censorship , which was vigilantly following the direction of the magazine. Numbers 36 and 37 were not published and appeared only in 1991.

A review of the book:

https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://magazines.russ.ru/neva/2013/4/l9-pr.html&prev=search

	...The forerunner of the magazine "The Past" should be called "Historical-revolutionary collection" Byloe ", published by Vladimir Lvovich Burtsev (1862-1942) 5 in London-Geneva-Paris in 1900-1904. In the late autumn of 1905 he returned from exile to Russia, settled in the capital and asked permission from the authorities to continue publishing the historical collections "The Past" in Petersburg, which he was immediately denied6. VL Burtsev appealed to V. Ya. Bogucharsky and PE Shchegolev to become the official editors of the magazine he planned, and he and the owner of the publishing house "Don speech" Nikolai Yelpidiforovich Paramonov (1876-1951) 7 freely received permission to publish a monthly magazine "Past", dedicated to the history of the liberation movement. VL Burtsev actually became a full-fledged co-editor of the journal. His job was to collect the materials kept by the old revolutionaries. In October 1907, the decree of the St. Petersburg mayor published the magazine "The Past" was "suspended." In March 1909, by decision of the St. Petersburg Trial Chamber, P. Ye. Schegolev was sentenced to three years of solitary confinement "for distributing works of deliberately provoking rebellion". B. Ya. Bogucharsky was deported abroad, an experienced VL Burtsev, who was repeatedly expelled, Russia left in good time. The publication of the "Bylogo" resumed in 1917 and continued until 1926. Its editor and publisher was PE Shchegolev.

	...ARCHIVES, WITNESSES

	At the end of February - beginning of March 1917, almost simultaneously throughout Russia, fires burned, in which the documents of the Security Departments, the Gendarmerie Directorates, the Police Department and other services of the Ministry of the Interior of the Empire burned. The flame was absorbing priceless documents.

	In the first days of the February Revolution, enraged crowds of metropolitan residents set fire to the District Court building on Liteiny Prospekt and the old prison, the Lithuanian Castle, near the Theater Square. They burned to the ground. The fires broke out in the building of the Police Department on the Fontanka near the Panteleymonovsky Bridge and on Mytninskaya Embankment, where the Petrograd Security Department was smashed and burned. These two buildings with their contents were set on fire intentionally. Many wanted to exterminate the archives of the Security Department and the Special Department of the Police Department, they needed oblivion of the past as a guarantee of future existence.

	"True, here and there the gendarmerie officers managed to destroy lists of provocateurs," wrote the publicist SG Svatikov, "in some places a crowd, instigated by security agents, did not understand the meaning of what was happening, defeated the Security Departments and burned their archives and records. For example, a significant part of the archives of the Petrograd security department perished " [251] .

	All those who left memories of these strange fires of the spring of 1917 believed that their former guards had organized them.

	"Before the building of the Police Department," wrote the well-known archivist V. Maksakov, "huge fires of papers, documents, deeds, photographic cards thrown from the windows burned day and night on the Fontanka and Panteleymonovskaya street. In the room most of the cabinets were hacked, and books, files, individual papers piles covered the floors of a huge building. Some departments, for example, VIII office work, which dealt with cases of combating crime, were completely destroyed. Others suffered considerably. Fortunately, the room in which the Special Section of the Police Department was located did not suffer much. Here were the most valuable materials in the historical sense. They have been preserved almost completely " [252] .

	Someone reported on what was happening on the Fontanka in the Pushkin House of the Academy of Sciences. The indispensable secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Academician SF Oldenburg, was able to obtain several wagons, and an expedition consisting of PE Shchegolev, BL Modzalevsky, tl. A. Kotlyarevsky, A. S. Polyakov, A. A. Shilov, V. P. Semennikov and others, went to save the most valuable archives [253] . All that was saved, on March 3, was loaded into a sleigh and taken to the Vasilievsky Island to the Academy of Sciences. (Some of the saved documents were lost in 1918 when the archives were evacuated to Yaroslavl.) [254]

	In Moscow on March 1, 1917 in the palace along Gnezdnikovsky Lane, 5, bonfires flamed. Documents of the Security Department were burning. Someone wore papers in the bonfires, someone took for a folder, photos, brochures. "It was difficult to understand," wrote Maksakov, "who was more in this crowd," curious or former guards who aspired, as late as possible, to conceal in the fire of fires their traces of participation in the protection of the failed autocratic system. That there were a lot of former guards in the crowd could be seen from the fact that when checking the cases of the "secret police", especially its so-called "secret service department," it was subsequently found out that the lack of mainly personal files of secret employees, "agent notes" such documents, apparently, not accidentally disappeared during the "spontaneous" rout of the "secret police" and police stations.

	On the same day, a group of politicians and historians organized the protection of the documents of the "secret police" and their transportation to Red Square to the Moscow Historical Museum, where the reading room of the museum was adapted to accommodate archival materials " [255] .

	The situation was much worse in the provinces. There, the security offices burned simultaneously with the capital, first of all they destroyed personal affairs of secret employees and normative documents regulating the methods of the political investigation. News of the widespread destruction of the detective institutions of the former empire prompted the Provisional Government to urgently establish a Commission under the Ministry of Justice to liquidate the political affairs of the former Police Department. It was headed by the former Narodovolets VL Burtsev, who paid very little time to the Commission, which left part of the archives in the custody of their former custodians, officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Provisional Government "ordered the protection of police archives only when the official custodians left their posts and when many documents had already been plundered and destroyed" [256] .

	Seeing that the Burtsov Commission is inactive, on March 13, 1917, the Minister of Justice signed a letter with the following content:

	"I propose to Comrade Prosecutor Sluchevsky, PE Shchegolev, VM Zenzinov, NN Myasoyedov and Ensign Znamensky to review in the shortest possible time the documents seized in the Police Department and other institutions at my disposal and the results inform me.

	Minister of Justice AF Kerensky " [257] .

	The Burtsev commission was formally liquidated on June 15, 1917. Five days before its formation, the Provisional Government formed an Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry to investigate the unlawful actions of former ministers and other senior officials of civil, military and naval agencies [258] . In her work constantly participated: the famous Moscow lawyer NK Muraviev (chairman), senators SV Ivanov and SV Zavadsky (deputy chairmen), the chief military prosecutor VA Apushkin, the prosecutor of the Kharkov Chamber of Justice B. N. Smitten, prosecutor of the Moscow District Court LP Olyshev, academician S. F. Oldenburg, prosecutor of the Vilnius Chamber of Judges A. F. Romanov, representative of the State Duma F. I. Rodichev, from the Executive Committee of the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies N. D. Sokolov and the only historian P. Ye. Schegolev. The Commission invited the poet AA Blok to assist the journalist Mikhail Miklashevsky and the writer L. Ya. Gurevich, the scientific editorial staff, and the editorial staff was assisted by Professor E. Tarle.

	...Serving in the III department and the Police Department, Kletochnikov regularly passed on to the Narodnaya Volya heard from "colleagues" and read in the documents of these institutions. They came down to us in the form of copies copied by the Narodnaya Volunteers NA Morozov, LA Tikhomirov, SA Ivanova, and Ye. N. Figner. They contain valuable information about the political investigation and its secret employees. [151] . Based on these records, VL Burtsev published lists of secret agents disclosed by Kletochnikov [152] . They contain a description of 332 people. Mostly it's informers and episodic informers, only a small number of them can be attributed to provocateurs. Of course, this list can not claim to be exhaustive.

	...After the February Revolution, the commissions for the survey of archives of institutions subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs were formed outside the former Russian Empire. In March 1917, an émigré committee was formed in Paris, appealing to the Provisional Government with a request "for the admission of committee representatives to the sealed premises of the Foreign Agency for analyzing archives and for ascertaining the composition of secret employees" [264] . At the beginning of April, the Minister of Justice, AF Kerensky, and the chairman of the Extraordinary Investigation Commission, N. K. Muraviev, sent telegrams to Paris with a request to create a special commission to review the archives of the foreign secret police and send it to Russia. One of the Commission members VK Agafonov recalled: "On the doors of the Foreign Agency, located on the ground floor of the Russian consulate in Paris, we found the seals of the consulate and the personal seal of Krasilnikov, the head of the agency; removing them and unlocking the doors that were on the constipation, with two keys, not without excitement we entered the mysterious Parisian "secret police", consisting of only two relatively small rooms ... Here it is, the center from where the invisible hand directed its blows to the very heart of the Russian political emigration, there was a spider web that enveloped us and our comrades with a thousand thin but strong threads; here, we thought, satanic temptations were committed, and weak or already corrupted became final traitors " [265] .

	The archives of the overseas secret police were not burnt, they did not break, but he did not fully transfer to the new government. Krasilnikov and his assistants, before they sealed the security offices, some of the papers were withdrawn from the archive and not all were returned at the request of the commission.

	Two metropolitan commissions ceased to exist (the Commission for the Provision of the New Order and the Commission for Political Archives were dissolved), established in Moscow in March 1917 to save and preserve the archives of the institutions of the former Police Department, the various provincial commissions and the Commission for the Review of the Archive of the Overseas Secretaries ceased to function.

	Archives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and institutions subordinated to him, or rather, what remained of them, were in the hands of the new government. Historians and participants of the revolutionary movement used the first few years of some preserved documents. Then access to these archives was closed to all. But immediately after the October Revolution, many documents of the archives of the former Police Department were sealed [266] , and there is reason to believe that they have not been studied so far.

	The charge against Kerensky of double dealing with Kornilov has been satisfactorily refuted by Kerensky in his recent book, as Mr Wilcox admits in an appendix.

	Vladimir Lvovich Burtzev, active chiefly as a revolutionary propagandist in Petersburg and abroad after the failure of the 1905 uprising, had been a leading terrorist twenty and more years earlier. Now, though venerated by the younger generation of insurgents for his past achievements and appreciated for his present propaganda services, he was considered too meek and gentle to mix into current terrorist plotting.   He was never a member of any of the numerous revolutionary committees nor admitted to the inner councils.   He was above all not privy to the dead secrecy of assassination conspiracies.


Burtsev was a terrorist?


	...Whiffs of Treachery 	 
 	 
	In 1905 an unknown, veiled woman delivered a letter to a member of the underground at Petersburg which claimed that the Okhrana had two spies in the Socialist Revolutionaries' Combat Unit, a certain T., ex-convict, and the engineer Azev, a Jew recently arrived from abroad. Since Evno Azev was actually the top leader of the Combat Unit and the party's chief organizer of terror, the letter was dismissed by the revolutionaries as obviously an Okhrana trick. Azev himself, however, recognized the ex-convict T. as Tatarov, whom he knew to be another Okhrana penetration. He was anxious to deflect the threat to his own position and so urged an inquiry. Tatarov, interrogated by a commission, admitted nothing that would lead to proof of his betrayal, but he contradicted himself enough to increase the suspicion against him.   He was suspended from the party and finally, on Azev's motion, shot in his home at Kiev.
 
	Burtzev studied the Tatarov case. He realized that it would be preposterous for the Central Committee to prefer charges against Azev; on the other hand, Azev's furious insistence that Tatarov be killed struck him as excessive. There were ample indications in new denunciations and in the failure of planned terroristic acts that there was still, with Tatarov dead, a traitor in the party. Studying the failures, Burtzev noted that almost as a rule at assassination attempts, whether successful or not, Azev was never on the scene.


detective Burtsev mathematically proves you're a peice of shit and there's nothing you can do

	...In 1908 an agent of the Warsaw Okhrana who had decided to defect, Mikhail Bakai, approached Burtzev in Petersburg in his position as editor of the revolutionary journal Byloe (The Past). He offered a mass of information about the Okhrana and its Warsaw office that convinced Burtzev of his bona fides. Burtzev talked him into staying in place a little longer, until he had collected more information on the identities of secret agents. This gamble almost failed; soon thereafter Bakai was arrested and sent to Siberia. But he escaped and came again to Burtzev. Among the new information he had acquired was the identity of the penetration agent who had reported his intention to defect and so caused his arrest.   His name was Raskin.
 	 
	The revolutionaries did not know that Raskin was the Okhrana's name for Azev; still, this was a pointer for Burtzev


Got info from Mikhail Bakai


	...The Azev case was only the beginning of a flood of exposures. Bakai had brought the names or aliases of thirty-odd agents connected with the Okhrana's Warsaw branch. Moreover, an Okhrana headquarters staff officer, Leonid Menshchikov, had also defected just before Bakai. Although he had only the code names and fragmentary information on the activities of penetration agents, he provided leads that Burtzev patiently pursued until in June of 1909 he could announce to the world that the celebrated socialite Arkadiy Harting, who as head of the Okhrana abroad was chiefly responsible for its prestige in Western Europe, was actually a miserable little provocateur and since 1890 a fugitive from French justice for his part in a terrorist plot. Paris Okhrana never recovered fully from this blow.
 
	Thus Burtzev, once looked upon as an obnoxious meddler, a disgruntled has-been making irresponsible accusations, became the heroic "Sherlock Holmes of the Russian Revolution" and chief adversary of the Okhrana as counterintelligence officer first for the Social Revolutionaries and their Combat Unit, then for the Leninist Social Democrats, the Anarcho-Communists, and other groups. His triumphant operations would before long begin to turn sour, but in the meantime they had their day. 


So Burtsev and defectors uncover a bunch of Okhrana plots and he becomes "Sherlock Holmes of the Revolution"

was "chief adversary of the Okhrana" for Social Revolutionaries, Leninist Social Dmmeocrats, Anarcho-Communists, and others.


	...After his permanent move to Paris in 1908, Burtzev maintained a residence at 116 rue de la Glaciere until October 1914. From the beginning this apartment served also as his editorial office, first for the weekly Byloe, then for Budushchee (The Future).   It was thus here that he met party leaders, members of various committees, and the general public and kept his library and intelligence files. As his intelligence activities expanded, however, he rented several other offices and also made operational use of the quarters of his principal assistants, initially Mikhail Bakai and the lawyer and journalist Valerian Agafonov. 


Started his counter-intel op with Bakai and Valerian Agafonov.


	...Burtzev's triumph had been due partly to Agafonov and a split among Socialist Revolutionaries. The party's Central Committee had been formed in Paris under the leadership of a few exiled revolutionaries of considerable wealth such as Viktor Chernov and Mark Natanson.   In frequent conflict with these leaders were a number of professional people, lawyers and journalists in exile, most of them struggling for their livelihood. These, like Burtzev, considered the leaders too lax and complacent about the possibility of Okhrana penetrations. In 1908 they were organized as an "Opposition Group" of about a hundred members by Agafonov, who started publishing their small journal, Revolutsionnaia Mysl (Revolutionary Thought). Agafonov was assisted by Gnatovsky and Yudelevsky. 


Burtsev and other revolutionaries thought wealthy "revolutionaries" like Cernov and Natanson were too lax about Okhrana penetrations.


	...Burtzev joined the Group at once and published in the new journal an article, entitled "Black Book of the Russian Liberation Movement," concerning exposed Okhrana agent Mechislav Kensitski and others accused of being traitors to the revolution; this was the beginning of his campaign against penetrations. More importantly, he thus acquired the leaders of the opposition as his voluntary assistants and agents, who gathered frequently in secret meetings and brought him information on the doings and contacts of all the active revolutionaries.
 	 
	Okhrana chief Harting was, until his own exposure, fully informed of these developments and the progress of Burtzev's debriefing of defectors Menshchikov and Bakai. He had a penetration who was a member of the Opposition Group and so in constant touch with Burtzev and Agafonov. This agent now reported further that the Group, instead of searching in toto for spies and traitors, was forming a smaller special unit named the "Group of the Activist Minority" to watch closely the party members suspected of treason.   Agafonov and Ankel Yudelevsky headed this select body and reported to Burtzev daily. 


Burtsev was really into Okhrana penetration of the revolution and watched those suspected carefully. The Okhrana also took notice and watched him.


	...Bakai's Liga was a covert arm for Burtzev, who apparently did not trust his own office to be free of Okhrana agents (as it actually never was). The Liga was so completely conspiratorial that: even important members of the party were not given its address. Its task was to collect intelligence on the Okhrana and its agents and to investigate clandestinely the life of every member of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, his income, associations, and loyalty to the cause.   Harting expressed to headquarters his prescient apprehension about the Liga's activities and urged that all measures be taken to expel Bakai and Burtzev, as well as Agafonov and other "Activist Minority" leaders, from France.   He argued that neither in England nor in Switzerland could such revolutionary counterintelligence efforts cause as much damage as in France.
 
	In Okhrana terminology the task of Agafonov's Activist Minority was essentially internal, penetration of the Okhrana's penetrations, while Bakai's Liga was largely external, doing surveillance and detective-type investigations. Both units reported directly to Burtzev. Both of them, along with Burtzev's own office on the rue de la Glaciere, at first depended for support on the not large and not affluent Opposition Group. The funds were meager, but the agents were for the most part avid volunteers, often with moderate incomes of their own. 


Was head of counter-Okhrana intelligence and tried to penetrate their penetrations too


hired a guy named Leroy who knew a lot about the Okhrana's activities in France


	...In a number of operations during 1909 Burtzev arranged for the two external units, or at least their leaders, to work together. When it was learned that Harting was living incognito somewhere in Belgium, Burtzev quickly worked out a plan to locate him and if possible bring him clandestinely back to France, where the police would be alerted to arrest him. Burtzev thought this course would be of greatest propaganda value for the revolutionaries, but if kidnaping and delivery to France were impossible, they could carry out in Belgium the death sentence of their underground tribunal. Bakai and Leroy spent some three months of late 1909 in Belgium with their agents, Bakai investigating at Verviers, Leroy at Liege. They were confident of eventual success, but Harting had been informed of their assignment even before they left Paris. 


they tried to catch Harting, but Hartin was tipped-off


	...Burtzev was a most aggressive operator.   He did not wait for leads to put him on the track of traitors; he created situations to produce the leads. Early in April of 1912, for example, Paris Okhrana received two letters, one addressed to the ambassador and the other to the consul general, from unknown persons offering their services as agents.   Not suspecting that both were written by Burtzev's service, the Okhrana wrote back giving the two applicants appointments at different times and places. It even gave one a second appointment in response to a plea that the first reply had arrived too late. Neither of the two ever showed up.
 
	But two of the addresses proposed for the meetings were, as Burtzev had suspected, used also for the mailed reports of penetration agents. His only purpose in the fake applications had been to obtain such addresses. His surveillance men now went to work and intercepted the mail for them, which gave him the code names of two Okhrana agents, Karpo and Kodak.


Burtsev would use tricks to extract info out of the Okhrana


	...One case in which Burtzev was completely wrong was that of a revolutionary activist named Smolyansky. In falsely accusing him of being an Okhrana agent, he built his case entirely on circumstantial evidence. This included the suspect's intercepted mail and letters from accusers, anonymous and signed. His :income was unexplained, and his movements were suspicious. One of his purloined writings was about the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, and Burtzev saw this as clearly the draft for an agent report. Then Burtzev received a report that a brother of Smolyansky's was a police official in Russia. He regarded the evidence as sufficient to warrant exposing the man as an agent. 


But Burtsev got too confident and got one accusation wrong


	...On 19 April, without explanation, both prisoners were told the death sentence was commuted. The revolutionaries had apparently decided it would be too dangerous to carry out the execution: too many people knew about the trial and the concierge had seen too much; the liquidation could be done later, away from Paris. The prisoners were told that they were expelled from the party but would have to report all changes of address. Both were released.
 	 
	Tatiana was given back 40 francs of her money.   She took a train to Germany. Three armed revolutionaries accompanied her, but she succeeded in escaping from them. She returned to Russia and told the Okhrana this story.


They catch Tatiana and she admits it, but for some reason decide to let her go and she tells the Okhrana.


	...After Burtzev's triumph in exposing Azev and Harting, no revolutionary group was able to refuse his services or to ignore his warnings and directives. The central committees had to accept him in their councils and consult him on the security of projected operations and the loyalty of participating activists. Thus he acquired a peculiar authority over revolutionary operations and the top party leaders. He was frequently able to tell them to change or drop their operational plans.
 
	After Natanson and Chernov, for example, had in 1913 approved a project to dispatch Ziama Kisin with a team to Petersburg to murder Minister of Education Kaso, Burtzev warned them that the conspiracy might have been penetrated by the Okhrana. When they wanted to go ahead with the operation despite his warnings, he threatened to expose them as provocateurs if anything should go wrong.   They had to drop the plan. 


Burtsev so good that he had power over their operations and people were afraid of him


	...His authoritarian attitude led to a gradual loss of support from the Socialist Revolutionaries and other groups of political exiles. He became chronically short of the funds required to maintain his expanded services. Bakai, after he broke with him, wrote him a public letter in which he charged him with squandering money


but it might have got the best of him


	...Opposition to Burtzev increased particularly in the first months of 1914. Rumors were spread to show him full of naivete or senile. He was called an old autocrat who conjured up suspects by intuition, without factual intelligence information and proof. He was charged with an obsession for exposing police agents regardless of how much he hurt the revolutionary movement. 


Burtsev was really into exposing the Okhrana, but Bolsheviks didn't see to mind as much.


	...With a new series of errors in exposing Okhrana agents the criticism came to a head in mid-1914, and Burtzev lost all financial support from the revolutionary groups. His teams of French external agents disintegrated because their salaries were not paid, and his wide circle of Russian collaborators gradually deserted him. By the time the war broke out in August he was actually destitute, without support from anywhere and thus without a service. He returned to Russia, escaping a throng of creditors to face in the imperial courts the charges of sedition against him.


eventually they got him in mid-1914, Burtsev lost funding, and apparently Revolutionaries lost their counter-intelligence.


	...There had been times when Vladimir Lvovich had been wanted dead or alive by the Tsarist regime. Returning to Petrograd in wartime, however, he found the authorities unexpectedly lenient. A free man even before the first revolution broke out, he went back to newspaper work in 1917, publishing Obshchee Delo (Common Cause). He now became an ardent critic of Bolshevism. Despite his many past services for Lenin's party, therefore, he found it healthiest to return to exile soon after the October Revolution. In Paris he continued his Obshchee Delo for several years. His death came in 1942 at the age of 80. 


sometimes wanted dead or alive by Okhrana. They were unexpectedly lenient to him when he returned to Petrograd, and he went back to publishing a newspaper in 1917 while being anti-Bolshevik. Had to return to exile after October revolution.

	One question, which both Ambassadors had to 
raise, was of peculiar delicacy; and both he and Buchanan were 
seriously embarrassed when they were called upon by their 
Governments to plead the cause of Vladimir Burtsev. This is one 
of the most remarkable characters in the whole of our story. He 
was closely in touch with the revolutionary parties, and he was 
specially interested in terrorism, as a weapon to be used only when 
the Government refused all concessions to public opinion. He was 
at one time not inappropriately tried, sentenced and imprisoned 
in England for his frank publication of this view. But his interest 
was not that of an agent but of a scholar, and it is typical that he 
was arrested on coming out of the British Museum. He was the 
best expert on the history of the revolutionary movement and was 
in fact, so to speak, a revolutionary detective, with a ‘flair’ superior 
to that of any of the police. He was constantly exposing the 
Russian police agents abroad, with such success that at one time 
they all had to be changed: so we are told by Beletsky himself, 
who was then Director of the Police Department. ^ It was Burtsev, 
who, with unflagging cleverness and assiduity, had ultimately 
succeeded in proving to the leaders of the Social Revolutionaries 
that the president of their terrorist section, Azef, was serving 
simultaneously as a police spy. Burtsev, under certain circum- 
stances, could defend or even advocate terrorism, but, as he has 
put it, ‘he objected to murders by a police agent’. So unwilhng 
were they to listen to him that at one time he was in danger at their 
hands; but ultimately his proofs were so thorough and convincing 
that Azef was tried by his colleagues, condemned and shovelled 
away into retirement, where later his accuser paid him a friendly 
and scholarly visit to verify some doubtful point. Burtsev used to 
talk freely to the heads of the Police Department. His method was 
to start by showing them a good part of what he already knew and 
thereby extract more. No one ever had such an intimate know- 
ledge of the scum of Russian politics on both sides of that vague line 
which separated the police from the revolutionaries. 


Burtsev knew his shit

	Immediately after the Revolution of March 
1917 Kerensky, as the new Minister of Justice, set up his investi- 
gating commission manned by some of the best lawyers in Russia 
which interrogated in detail all the chief actors in this period. The 
questions put to them, according to the most clement procedure 
of western justice, were exactly those on which we should most 
desire information, and we have verbatim their answers. 

	It is from this last-named abundant material that we draw our 
principail information on the period which is now being described. 
Two of the chief villains of the piece — for this period S. P. 
Beletsky, and for a later period A. D. Protopopov — proving 
amenable in examination to give in detail all that they knew, 
were invited by the Chairman of the Commission to write it out 
in full; and one of the seven volumes of this report is devoted 
entirely to these two men, and mainly to the record of Beletsky. 
He took a certain curious literary pride in writing it, though it 
is in a florid and involved style, almost German in kind, suggestive 
of an official police report; in fact he calls it ‘an act of accusation 
against myself’; ^ but it is full of detailed and balanced statements, 
which can often be verified from other sides. Burtsev, who knew 
Beletsky well, considers that it can be trusted entirely. “ It is quite 
frank and tells the story exactly as any intelligent person would 
see it, almost without self-consciousness and quite without any 
mercy for his own part in it. He begins with the words: ‘I will 
write my evidence or rather my confession’; and he stops at some 
of the most extravagant facts which he has to relate, to say how 
even he was compelled to blush for his part in them,® or to ex- 
claim: ‘I was bathing in dirt.’* 

	Stephen Beletsky, who was personally known to me, was 
a typical professional police official, a thorough man of the world, 
very careful and resourceful in detail, who by years of able service 
in various posts had before the War risen to that of Director of the 
Department of Police. He was not an honest man, and could 
never have been regarded as such, whether by himself or by 
others; but he had exactly the abilities required by his office.


Burtsev and Bernard Pares vouch for the credibility of a testimony by Beletski


but iirc Pares is sketchy

	This circumstance gave Bogrov the hope that he could commit a terrorist act not over Kulyabka, but over the Tsar or Stolypin. On August 30 or 31, Bogrov saw both the Tsar and Stolypin, but for some reason he did not dare to shoot. On September 1, he finally decided to shoot Stolypin. The last motive for this decision was the fact that Bogrov believed that on that day his relations with the security department were fully established by his comrades, since his conversation with Kulyabka was overheard by one of his comrades. That Bogrov was the most active anarchist, I know from a statement that I received, for example, in 1912 from a hard labor prison from his comrade, now an employee of the "Russian Gazette", released from hard labor under a full amnesty, Sandomirsky. I printed Sandomirsky's letter in the same year in 1912 in The Future, where Sandomirsky denies the possibility of Bogrov's service in the security department, speaks of him as the most active Kiev anarchist. In the "Future" (No. 3), I autographed Bogrov with his autograph of his report on the assignments assigned to him by the party. About the fact that Bogrov served in the security department, received money and gave information, in addition to official documents, I know from private conversations with people who served in the political police, for example - Dobroskok, Spiridovich, etc. I often heard opinions about , that Bogrov had some kind of contact with Kulyabka, Kurlov and Spiridovich in the murder of Stolypin.

	October 25, 1917, the day of storming the Winter Palace, Burtsev issued the first and only issue of the newspaper "Our Common Cause." His editorial began with the words: "Citizens, save Russia!". The number was confiscated - this time by order of Trotsky, and the journalist was arrested the same day and again fell into the Trubetskoi bastion of the Peter and Paul Fortress, in which he was sitting under Alexander III and under Nicholas II. Burtsev, thus, became the first political prisoner of Soviet Russia - the Ministers of the Provisional Government joined him later. Among them, by the way, was the former director of the police department Beletsky, from which the journalist did not depart a single step.

	The Bolsheviks planted Burtsev, of course, not for an article. The fact is that in July 1917 he published a list of the names of 159 emigrants who returned to Russia through the territory of Germany. Burtsev was quite sure: "The October 25, 1917 coup that overthrew the authority of the Provisional Government and established the power of the Soviets was committed by the Germans through their agents, on their money and on their instructions."



So what was going on here? the "Citizens! Save Russia!" article was also where he was said to have attacked General Verkhovsky

from Burtsev's memoirs:

	The danger to the right for me was clear even then, under Alexander III, but it became even clearer under Nicholas II - especially in the autumn of 1916, when the rightists were ruining Russia and preparing chaos in Russia. 
   The danger to the left was clear to me even then. It could be seen even more clearly in 1905, Her only blind man could not see in 1914-16, - I'm not talking about 1917, when the power was in the hands of Kerensky and his adherents, who themselves imagined a state danger.
   But both among the rightists and among the left - the minority in both camps - there were certain state trends that the people's interests always placed above their program and who would never want to make an experimental field from the people to apply their doctrines. 
   I attached great importance to the union of these two trends, left and right, and in their mutual struggle saw a huge, menacing danger for Russia. 
   I was convinced that only their union and can ensure the proper development of the country and bring it to the broad road of free true democracy.


interesting--Burtsev see the same problem of left and right divided in his country, leading it to catastrophe?

okhrana-bolsheviks

https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.276141/2015.276141.Three-Who_djvu.txt
	Though less ruthless and thorough in the suppression of oppo- 
nents, and enormously less numerous than the GPU to which we 
have become accustomed, the Okhrana was second to no other 
secret political police of its day. Where peasant risings and mutinies 
gave it the pretext, it proclaimed martial law and used gallows 
and firing squad. In other provinces, it made use of the power of 
administrative deportation without trial, up to a maximum of five 
years in Siberia. But a roster of millions of prisoners in concentra- 
tion camps would have seemed an incredible nightmare to this little 
band of routine-incrusted police officials. According to the testi- 
mony of its chief, Vasiliev, at the height of its power it never had 
more than one thousand secret agents in all Russia, nor more than 
one hundred in the capital. He complains that he had "very few” 
operatives abroad and, every time a congress was held in foreign 
parts, had to further debilitate his Moscow and Petersburg forces 
by sending some of his best agents. 

	But, with its years of political experience, the Okhrana sensed 
earlier than Lenin the nature of the new political situation, and 
prepared, too, to “go underground” once more. With forces that 
seem numerically so modest today, it now developed a system of 
espionage that eclipsed even the Zubatov and Gapon experiments. 
If, at every stage of our story so far we have found a police agent 
in the midst of each fairly numerous gathering, now we shall find 
them penetrating into the topmost secret hierarchies of the Social 
Revolutionary Party and the Bolshevik faction of the Social Demo- 
cratic Party.

	By the very end of 1915, agents had been set up, and reports were already in my hands that outlined the nature of the future's tasks set by this organization and its desire to play a dominant role in the direction of the labor movement.


Okhraa had "desire" to play "dominant role" in labor movement, what about Beletsky? his motive seems a mystery so far


	...All this, in connection with the discovery of the secret mission pursued by M. Vasilchikov, sent with secret letters to Petrograd, gave me grounds to become interested in this matter and to clarify the role and activities of gendarme officers sent to the headquarters of the armies. It turned out that, due to the highest approved instruction, during the secondment period, they were not subordinate to either the headquarters or the department, they did not have experienced managers, and communications [ 143 ] they did not keep internal agents, and in this important, especially during the war, internal coverage of the country in this area was weak. In view of this, after reporting this gene.



doesn't translate well. Were Gendermes doing their own thing for awhile?

	It was in the wonderland world of the Bolshevik Party that the constant interplay between *agents provocateurs* and the Leninists' own methods had the most lasting consequences. One government agent, Roman Malinovskii, rose to the exalted position of the leading Bolshevik in Russia while Lenin was in enforced exile, also serving as chair of the party's Duma fcation in 1912-1914. Even when he was exposed, an incredulous Lenin initially kept him in place, not fully facing the facts until 1917. According to Robert Service moreover, Malinovkskii's 'main task was to remove any obstacles to the schismatic measures [within the revolutionary left] proposed by Lenin.' 'The Okrana saw Lenin ... the single greatest obstacle to unity amongst Russian Marxists ... as a brilliant executor of the task demanded by the Emperor: the disintigration of the RUssian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The enhancement of Lenin's career was [indirectly] the Okhrana's confidential priority.' Their intersts certainly coincided. 'The Okhrana wished to splinter the resurgent workers' movement and Lnin wished to bring it under his control.' The secret police were happy to concentrate on arresting Lenin's opponents on the party's Central Committee, the 'Concilitators,' to make any reconciliation between Bolsheviks and Menshevks unlikely (the RSDLP split into the two factions in 1903; reconciliation proved impossible after 1912).

sketchy guy Prince Andronnikov tells him to get to know Rasputin, which he does. Beletsky tells Rasputin "we're cool" because Beletsky supposedly didn't try to kill him while head of Okhrana.

Andronnikov also hooks up Beletsky with his candidate for Minister of the Interior Khvostov, the leader of the Rights in the Duma. Khovstov gets elected by Sep 1915 and with Beletsky help try to smooth things over between Tsar and Duma. Rapsutin's support is needed for this.

Khovstov later tells Beletsky to ruin Rapsputin, which he supposedly tries to do without care for doing dirty work.


This is all according to Beletsky.

Fontanka book:

	Ivan in turn began to
expel boyars from his new country and to give their lands to his own
agents. To command Russia as a whole, he formed a terrorist band of
pseudo-monks, the oprichniki, and sent them out to frighten resistors
into subservience.
Bearing symbolic brooms and the severed heads of dogs on the
saddles of their black horses, the black-robed oprichniki made clear
4 Fontanka 16
their mandate to sniff out and sweep away opponents of Ivan. Two
foreigners among them, J. Taube and Elbert Kruze, identified the tsar
as their monastic head: "Himself [Ivan iv] was the Father Superior,
Prince Afanasy Viazemsky was the Cellarer, Maliuta Skuratov was the
Sexton and along with the others they managed the various activities
of monastery life. Himself, both of his sons, and the Sexton would
ring the bell." Members not in church each morning at four "were
sentenced to eight days penance." 3
As the infamy of the oprichniki spread, one visiting Englishman, the
trader and diplomat Jerome Horsey, wrote of their acts: "This crueltie
bread such a generall hatred, distreccion, fear, and discontentement
thorow his kyngdom, that there wear many practices and devises how
to distroy this tirant; but he still did discover their plotts and treasons,
by inoiblinge and countenancinge all the rascalest and desperatt soul-
diers he could peek owt, to affront the chieff nobillitie." 4
Showing signs of deepening derangement, Ivan iv insisted that
plotters lurked everywhere. To identify them, he put select oprichniki
to work as political investigators under M.L. Skuratov-BePsky and
V.G. Griaznoi, who solicited denunciations as their prime source of
evidence. That many came forward caused a German then in Russia,
A. Schlichting, to write: "Muscovites seem to possess a kind of innate
malevolence that makes them accuse and slander one another in front
of the tyrant and fume with hatred for one another so that they kill
themselves by mutual slander." 5
Sometimes the oprichniki concocted charges, as Skuratov and Griaz-
noi did to rid the tsar of a cousin, Prince Vladimir Staritsky, whose
rule over a separate territory made him suspect. Soon after his arrival
for a visit, the two confronted Staritsky with the charge that his cook
had confessed to a plot to poison Ivan. Thus justified, they forced the
prince to down a lethal drink.
Likewise targeted was the Metropolitan Philip, the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, who came into disfavour for interceding
on behalf of innocent persons denounced as traitors. The bribe for
Philip's accuser was a bishop's mitre. When, during a visit from
Skuratov, Philip died in the monastery where he was imprisoned, the
chief of the oprichniki blamed the airlessness of Philip's cell.
Whole families, clans, and even townships fell victim, but most
brutal was the 1571 purge of Novgorod, a formerly independent city-
state that Ivan distrusted. As told in the "Chronicle" of Novgorod, a
tramp directed the oprichniki - very likely the instigators - to a forged
document conveying that Novgorodians wanted to serve the king of
Poland, then at war with Ivan. 6 A three-week probe followed, during
which the oprichniki tortured and killed thousands. Some reports set
5 Political Investigation to 1825
the toll at sixty thousand, but historians estimate from two thousand
to fifteen thousand fatalities. 7


origins of the Okhrana?

	...During this same year, Pahlen assessed the security implications of
the populist agitators in an official report. 4 The Third Section should,
he wrote, spread agents throughout society to detect and stifle subver-
sives before they acted against the state. Gendarmes and security
agents should, for example, monitor all self-education circles because
radicals used such groups to inflame well-meaning persons into com-
mitting crimes.

	Even more important, Pahlen urged that security agents infiltrate the
secret cells of revolutionaries to enable the Third Section to foil their
plots and arrest their members, a course that would, in a few years,
become a major thrust of the tsarist security force. He left unexamined
how such arrestees would be investigated and processed, just as he
said nothing about his ongoing concern that Gendarmes, as Third
Section agents, too often put security objectives above judicial stan-
dards during preliminary inquiries and, since 4 June 1874, judicial
investigations.


their signature characteristic of infiltrating revolutionary, criminal organizations


	...Within months, in the summer of 1879, the underground revolu-
tionary party, People's Will, combined a number of radical cells into
a single terrorist organization. As conspirators, these narodniki
sharply differed from the naive radicals whom police had so easily
rounded up when they went to the people in 1874. To move freely
and anonymously, for example, the narodniki forged internal passports
47 Third Section to Department of Police
for themselves that bore false names. They used the proper forms, an
archive of official signatures, and appropriate stamps and seals.
People's Will also placed an agent of its own within the Third
Section. The idea belonged to Alexander Mikhailov, a leader of
People's Will and a revolutionary of iron will and absolute convic-
tions. Back in 1878, he had met Nicholas Kletochnikov, a sickly,
leftist provincial, adrift in his mid-thirties, and had sensed his longing
for a noble commitment. Mikhailov had therefore convinced Kletoch-
nikov that he could be enormously useful if he would join the Third
Section and inform on its activities. On Mikhailov's advice, Kletoch-
nikov had taken rooms adjacent to those of a Third Section officer's
widow and then cultivated her. Through her ministrations and influ-
ence, he had become a valued specialist in the Third Section in 1879
and had gravitated into its political department, the Third Secretariat,
later that same year.
As a trusted insider, Kletochnikov was able to copy the most secret
documents and pass them on to People's Will, and he used his extraor-
dinary ability for memorization to the same end. Lev Tikhomirov, the
terrorist, personally dealt with Kletochnikov and credited him with an
impressive capacity for detail. "He studied with strong interest and
devotion, and his notes about the matters that passed before him had
the quality of those of a talented novelist. He passed on not only
names and pseudonyms of agents, but even striking portraits of each
of them, wonderfully capsulized in a few words. He described their
physical features, character, and habits." i5
Kletochnikov would move to the Third Section's successor agency
in 1880 and avoid detection as a radical spy until January of 1881.
In his subsequent statements to interrogators and the judges who
would convict him of treason, he would claim not to have known that
he was dealing with terrorists. Although his death sentence would be
commuted to life imprisonment, he would die behind bars in 1883.


People's will had a prominent agent in third section in 1879


	...Meanwhile, in August 1879 Alexander n had again nearly fallen
victim to an assassin. In a widely publicized follow-up, People's Will
made the chilling announcement that it had condemned the tyrant tsar
to death. The group gained yet more notoriety in November when
several of its terrorists used dynamite, the recent invention of Alfred
Nobel, to blow up the train that they mistakenly thought was carrying
the tsar.
A still greater impact would result three months later from the
assassination attempt by Stepan Khalturin, who, by securing a posi-
tion as a mechanic at the Winter Palace, had managed to smuggle
several pounds of dynamite into the basement of the palace, two floors
below the imperial dining room. While Khalturin was making his
48 Fontanka 16
preparations, Third Section agents arrested a leader of People's Will,
A.A. Kviatkovsky, and found among his papers a plan for the Winter
Palace with the imperial dining room marked by an X. Police at once
conducted a surprise nighttime search in the mechanics' quarters but
missed the dynamite that Khalturin was concealing under his pillow.
On 4 February 1880, he lit a fuse and walked out of the palace. The
huge explosion destroyed the guard room immediately below the
dining room, killed eleven persons, and injured fifty-six more, but the
blast entirely missed the tsar and his circle. They had not yet entered
the dining room, which, in any case, suffered little damage.


Third sections bungles some prominent assassination attempts vs. Tsar, misses large quantities of dynamite under pillow


	...Intended to kill the tsar, the dynamite put an end to the Third
Section by forcing Alexander to reorganize his security forces. Named
to impose central control over all security personnel was his new
Supreme Executive Committee for the Preservation of State Order and
Public Tranquillity. Given dictatorial powers as its head was Count
Mikhail T. Loris-Melikov, a distinguished general in the Russo-Turkish
War of 1877-8. Although he soon became known as "vice-Emperor,"
Loris-Melikov would show a commitment to reform that would
prompt many to term his time in office a "dictatorship of the heart."


leads to reorganizations of secret police


	...Taken into custody in January 18 81 was a dedicated terrorist in the
People's Will, Ivan Okladsky, who, when threatened with a long
sentence of hard labour, agreed to switch his allegiance to the tsar.
Soon after he revealed the locations of two apartments, one printing
plant, and one dynamite factory belonging to his former comrades. He
would enter imperial service as a secret agent and play that role for
the next thirty-seven years. 35 In January, as well, the revolutionaries
lost their eyes and ears at Fontanka 16 because their spy Kletochnikov
was exposed.


arresting a guy to turn him as an agent


	...Ignat'ev had already set police work on a new course. Political
investigations by non-uniformed state agents had grown dramatically
since the assassination of Alexander 11. Increased surveillance of the
public was now being conducted by outside agents, 49 and more inside
agents were infiltrating subversive groups. Now both secretly served
the newly-named successor of the Third Section, the Division for the
Protection of Order and Social Security, over time to be commonly
known as the Okhranka.


so not sure of details but sounds like assassinations led to paranoia, increased power of secret police


	...Inside agents had to make their way onto the territory of the enemy
by winning acceptance as terrorists themselves. They were required to
operate under strict rules and could never relax their guard. Only with
express permission from their superiors in the Okhranka could they
use illegal weaponry and distribute illegal literature. Should they
commit a criminal act without prior approval, they were subject to
prosecution. (Should they be caught in a group arrest of subversives,
on the other hand, the Okhranka eased them into safety in ways that
did not make their radical comrades suspicious.) Barred from having
a wide circle of friends and owning frivolous possessions, these disci-
plined, self-restrained agents were not unlike monastics. Each inside
agent swore to report nothing but the truth, used code names for
himself and others, dealt in secret with a single Okhranka contact -
his case officer or controller - and forfeited his job if he lost his cover
or credibility. He or she dealt with pressures and risks on a daily basis.
The controller therefore constantly tested both the reports and the
psychological state of his agents. Given the stresses, the inside agent
usually retired within two years, or sooner, if his controller insisted.


this seems off


wasn't that other guy an agent for 37 years?

they don't seem very "disciplined" or "self-restrained" either


	...There were other revolutionaries who, without solicitation from the
Okhranka, stepped forward to place their expert knowledge of the
revolutionary movement at the disposal of the police. Alert to counter-
penetration from the revolutionaries, the Okhranka was naturally
suspicious of those who volunteered to work for the police. One of
these one-time revolutionaries was P.S. Statkovsky, who eventually
headed the Okhranka, first in St Petersburg and then in the St Peters-
burg region, until he retired in 1912, with honours


another revolutionary guy heading the Okhrana


	...A police agent, who remains anonymous to this day, describes a
different route to a position in the police in his memoir in 1917. 13 The
author tells that he was enrolled at St Petersburg University in 1912.
during the crackdown on student unrest by the minister of public
education, Leo Kasso. When the Okhranka approached him to report
on student behaviour as an insider, he saw no harm in describing
legitimate student grievances. He himself led a protest against the
firing of several liberal professors only to suffer arrest and imprison-
ment for two years. Denied readmission to the university after his
release, he found his income as a tutor insufficient to support his wife
and daughter. Only with a certificate of political reliability could he
resume work for a coveted university degree, so he asked the Okhranka
to give him one. Statkovsky, now a top officer in St Petersburg,
demanded service in return. The student was to use his renewed
contact with agitators in the university to evaluate secret denuncia-
tions already in the hands of the police. He could, after all, save many
innocent persons from unfair punishment. Statkovsky reminded his
petitioner: "You suffered and ought to know how important it is to
know the truth ... I propose that you correct our work."


so what where they feeding this guy bullshit?

	At their next meeting in a cafe, Statkovsky brought along a blond
man in glasses with a kindly appearance, whom he presented as Ivan
Fedorov, the student's contact with the Okhranka. Then Statkovsky
excused himself. Fedorov, as the conversation developed, turned out
to have "an exceptional mind, familiarity with literature, history,
social science; he did not resemble the Gendarmes who had crudely
conducted the interrogation into my case; each of his words was
redolent of a suborning gentleness. He spoke with a soft smile sin-
cerely and simply." This was Dobrovolsky, then the notorious head of
the St Petersburg Okhranka's secret agents.


his handler won him over, apparently well-spoken and came off as kind 


	Restored to the university, the student received regular payments
from the Okhranka, but his assignments became more demanding. He
was to evaluate the student "mood," although without naming per-
sons. Next came pressure for the names of leaders of the continuing
anti-Kasso agitation at the university. Von Kotten, the overall head of
the St Petersburg Okhranka, made himself known and underscored the
demand for detailed reporting. The student now heard a threat from
the Okhranka: "Do not try to operate on two fronts ... If you do, we
shall have to part from you. If so, we will deal with you in a political
sense and will spread the word about our conversations with you ...
I say this by the way. I hope that you will understand that you must
pass along information on everything that -happens ... We do not
demand provocations [incitement of others to illegal acts] from you,
but only want to be au courant on all events."



ended up blackmailing him and wanted information from him


	Soon the reluctant agent learned that his reports had provided the
sole grounds for several arrests. With persons denounced by him
suffering in prison, the student felt deepening remorse. His comrades,
moreover, began to suspect that he was an informer. The student
therefore asked for a court of honour, claiming in his memoir that he
hoped, without confessing his guilt, to be expelled and thereby
released from his burden. To his dismay, Statkovsky assured him that
the court would exonerate him because two members of the panel
were Okhranka agents.


so they had a lot of agents probably


	At this point, the student claims to have lost faith in "truth and
justice" and concluded that the Okhranka's power was without limit.
Already totally compromised, he decided to raise his earnings to those
of a full-fledged officer of the Okhranka. Suborning was everywhere,
but the student blamed neither the Okhranka nor himself. The fault
lay with "the system, the environment of the government and society,
that life of abnormalities which drives a man from the revolution to
the Okhranka and from the Okhranka back to the revolution."


decides Okhrana is all-powerful, sells soul to them and blames "the system"

	Even as radicals were enlisting in the Okhranka, through a combi-
nation of inducements, subtle pressures, and threats, there were
Okhranka agents and officers who were passing over to the revolu-
tionaries. The American writer Lincoln Steffens, for years an investi-
gative reporter of corruption in the governments of large cities,
observed psychological similarities in many policemen and the crimi-
nals they pursued. Numerous corrupt policemen, although remaining
overtly law enforcement officers, engaged in criminal activity. 14 In
Russia, of course, not only did the police become "criminals," in the
sense that they joined the radicals; but the reverse also happened: the
"criminals" became able and dedicated policemen. Steffens did not
observe this reverse phenomenon in America, but it was characteristic
of the Okhranka that some of its best agents and officers had started
their careers as dedicated opponents of the imperial regime.


blurred lines between Okhrana and "the revolution"


	Crossing the line from one side to the other offered no great change
in the nature of the work. Both camps operated extensive clandestine
organizations and used similar methods. Both camps included many
opportunistic persons who transferred their allegiances from one side
to the other at will. On the other hand, some of the defectors who
had been totally dedicated to a cause became disillusioned, and
deserted to work for the enemy. Another factor was that each side was
actively trying to recruit or place persons in the other camp because
of the enormous intelligence advantages to be gained. The existence
of persons extending blandishments naturally led to at least some who
were attracted by the bait. Then there were persons who managed to
help both sides substantially and it is extremely difficult even today to
calculate and compare their contribution to the police as against their
contribution to the revolutionaries.



I noticed that


	There is another possible motive for those who served one side and
then the other. Because there were agents who threw themselves into
their work - whether for the police or the revolutionaries - it seems
that the work, not the allegiance mattered most. They might have been
attracted to the thrill of dangerous life based on deception. There seem
to have been persons who relished the hunt, only they were the game
and their object was to deceive the hunters from both camps.


an interesting theory (was this Kim Philby?)



	...The Okhranka multiplied
entries quickly; well before 1914, their number exceeded one million,
each one of them on a colour-coded card. Yellow ones, for example,
denoted students; green was for anarchists. Red meant allegiance to
the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and blue to the Social Democrats.
Persons relegated to white cards had no known links to the revolu-
tionary movement, but were, for the most part, in the main stream of
cultural, social, and business affairs.



Red for commies, White for the rest of them



	...Fontanka also kept abreast of technical inventions that revolution-
aries might use. Through their own office on inventions, okhranniki
acquired information on new contrivances around the world and
maintained an archive of such developments. The first successful
flights of airplanes after the turn of the century attracted the attention
of the Okhranka because the new conveyance was a plausible instru-
ment for carrying out assassinations and terrorist attacks.


Okhrana always thinking ahead


	...Usually accurate, the perlustrators could make mistakes. On one
occasion they mixed up the envelopes from two embassies and sent on
to the Dutch foreign ministry a report written by a Spanish diplomat.
Another time, the perlustrator accidentally dropped into a courier's
portfolio a gold cuff link. The recipient decided that the gold cuff
belonged to the diplomat back at the embassy in St Petersburg and
sent it back to him. At the St Petersburg post office, the same per-
lustrator opened the portfolio on its return trip and to his delight
discovered his lost cuff link and reclaimed it. He destroyed the accom-
panying explanatory note to the diplomat.


hehe


	...Another Druzhina agent in Paris who subsequently served the For-
eign Agency was P.I. Rachkovsky, best remembered for his flamboyant
operations. 4 Rachkovsky, born into the hereditary gentry in Bessarabia
in 1853 but educated only at home, had first supported himself as a
minor bureaucrat and peripatetic informer for the Third Section. By
early 1879, he was editing a Jewish newspaper and contriving radical
links to make credible his subsequent "arrest" as a political criminal
- all to improve his usefulness as a full-fledged inside agent for the
Third Section.

	On 2,0 August 1879, however, exposure by the underground news-
paper of the People's Will of his role as a double agent had forced
Rachkovsky to leave Russia. When the tsar's assassination brought
him back in 1881 under a false name, Rachkovsky joined the Druzhina
and proceeded to Paris as part of the secret brotherhood's foreign spy
bureau. In 1882 he returned to Moscow, there to enter the reorganized
security force within V.K. Plehve's Police Department.


Rachkovsky involved in espionage before Okhrana


	...In this same period, Landezen continued to inform Rachkovsky
about Russian radicals in Switzerland, with whom he still mingled
easily as a seeming confederate. One tightly-knit group of explosive
experts that Landezen seems not to have penetrated - the Circle of the
People's Will, which was allied with a St Petersburg contingent that
included Lenin's older brother Alexander - gave itself away on 9 Feb-
ruary 1888 by accidentally detonating the bomb that it was assem-
bling. Swiss police easily apprehended one badly injured member, Isaak
Dembo, and learned enough from him before he died to establish
grounds for expelling nineteen of his comrades from Switzerland.


this mean anything? some circle of the people's Will in contact with Lenin's brother and the Okhrana deported them


	Maintaining his pose as a dedicated comrade, Landezen followed
the revolutionaries to Paris by transferring his studies to the French
agricultural institute. And at this juncture, in close proximity to the
headquarters of the Foreign Agency, he gained acceptance within the
radical emigre circles that included Tikhomirov. Although one or two
cautious revolutionaries pointed to circumstantial evidence that could
link Landezen with Rachkovsky, the absence of damning proof caused
most of the emigres, including a key leader, Vladimir Burtsev, to find
him trustworthy. To guard against compromising Landezen, only
Rachkovsky, Zvoliansky, Durnovo, Alexander in, and one or two
other officials knew the identity and accomplishments of the Foreign
Agency's most effective spy.


the spy who compromised them also knew Burtsev, who trusted him


	...Zvoliansky helped bring about the awarding of a medal to Rachkov-
sky, when a report deplored his lack of decoration despite "fifteen
years" of accomplished security work. Rachkovsky received the Order
of St Anna, third class. In addition, Zvoliansky urged that Rachkovsky
no longer be required to submit periodic reports, given the tremendous
demands of his work and his proved excellence in meeting them. The
Foreign Agency was "among the best (if not the best)" of Russia's
security sections, insisted the inspector, and all credit belonged to
Rachkovsky.


Hiding anything?


	...When he later wrote his memoirs, Burtsev would recall that he felt
merely surprise, not suspicion, when Landezen had suddenly reap-
peared in Paris in mid-January, just as he and Rapoport were making
plans to set off for Russia. 28 Burtsev had consequently felt no reserva-
tions about introducing Landezen to some bomb-making comrades
before he and Rapoport began their daring journey. 


Burtsev Landezen relatinship suspicious?


not sure exactly what's going on here bby apparently Landezen would infiltrate terrorists then later changed his name to Harting


	...On the diplomatic front, Landezen had helped forge better relations
between Russia and France by delivering the bomb-makers to the
French police in 1890. The reports of Rachkovsky convinced Alex-
ander in of the excellence of French cooperation with the Foreign
Agency, with the end result that a softening of differences between
autocratic Russia and republican France occurred in the 1890s.


Harting also contributing to Russia-France alliance


	...All these successes provided proof to St Petersburg of the essential
services, going well beyond their original mandate, that internal agents
and the Foreign Agency provided to the imperial government. Their
effectiveness against anti-tsarist groups coalescing in Russia and West-
ern Europe was axiomatic to their masters as they made themselves
indispensable in areas well outside of police work. Furthermore, they
pushed police work into new areas of criminal and semi-criminal
activity, political influence, and "public relations."


also doing PR and influence ops


	As Landezen had
shown, by far the best method of discovering who belonged to the
interdependent network of revolutionaries at home and abroad was to
infiltrate the ranks of plotters already known. It was a tricky business
requiring strong nerve and a special flair, two qualities that enabled
internal agents such as Landezen to do so well for so long. But it also
required inducing radicals to participate in breaking the law which, it
was argued, they would have done anyway.


like World War one! all those soldiers were just about to throw themselves into the trenches and murder each other anyway


	...By 1890, his fifth year as head of the Foreign Agency, Rachkovsky's
high standing with the tsar had translated into authority over imperial
security matters in Europe that few, if any, dared challenge. Thus it
was Rachkovsky who, each fall, personally headed the imperial body-
guard in Fredensborg during the tsar's annual vacation at the palace
of his mother-in-law, the Queen of Denmark. He was there, ready to
serve as the intermediary, when his agent Jules Hansen arrived in
September 1891, with a secret letter from the French premier, Charles
de Freycinet, proposing close military consultations between France
and Russia. 37

	Recalling this period, Count S.Iu. Witte, who became minister of
finance in 1892,, singled out Rachkovsky for being instrumental in
bringing France and Russia together in an entente. According to
Witte's rather extravagent assessment in his memoirs, Rachkovsky
"had more influence on the course of our rapprochement with France
[a military convention was agreed to in 1893-94] than did our ambas-
sadors." 38 Witte may have let his gratitude for the entente (which
made French banks a ready source of loans) colour his thinking, but
he further described Rachkovsky as a "remarkably intelligent man, in
fact the most gifted and intelligent police official I have ever met."


Rachkovsky credited with bringing France into Russia alliance



	...When Nicholas n succeeded his father in 1894, Rachkovsky pru-
dently watched for any moves against him by critics who might attempt
to exploit the change in leadership. His opponents in St Petersburg
could easily argue that his expenditures and gratuities were excessive,
especially during a lull in terrorism; they could question also his ethics,
his secret powers, and his high living. Vulnerable though he was,
however, Rachkovsky knew that most officials favoured granting him
free reign, given the amorality and secrecy of ruthless revolutionaries.


Rachovsky got dirt on the officials?

also had an assassin squad


	...Whether or not he had felt threatened, the next year Rachkovsky
formally expanded his operations into Berlin because, as he made clear
to St Petersburg, Russian emigres had concentrated there to avoid his
Paris-based security network. Adroitly preparing for a new centre of
Okhranka activity, Rachkovsky first obtained permission from the
German police to send six Russian agents into the German capital;
then, to win the necessary approval to build that force into an Agen-
tura or secret service, he summoned Landezen, now living in Belgium
under his new name of Harting, to take up residence in Berlin as a
wealthy Russian merchant with connections in high political circles.
Following the example of Rachkovsky, Harting courted local digni-
taries with sumptuous dinners at his fine house.


expand operations into Berlin, Harting schmoozing dignitaries


	At least by December 1900 the secret imperial Agentura in Berlin
was in full operation as an independent entity, and Harting would
command it until 1905. Among his agents would be Zinaida
Zhuchenko, Lev Beitner, and Dr Jacob Zhitomirsky, a deft infiltrator
who became a trusted collaborator of Lenin himself.


officially there by 1900


	...With his sphere of operations limited once more to France and
Switzerland as the new century began, Rachkovsky found himself
mainly confined to the commonplace task of embassies worldwide:
building foreign sympathy for his government and its causes. As he
had done since 1884, Rachkovsky routinely paid locals for pro-
Russian tracts and articles, including, besides Hansen, Calmette from
Figaro and Maurras from Petit Parisien. Giving a code name of
Ratmir to a writer named Raymond Recouli suggests that he hired
some journalists to gather intelligence as well. Or perhaps that he
exaggerated the role of favoured persons to justify raising their pay.


Rachkkovsky buying-off journalists

nice easy explanation of the parties:

https://historyrevision.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/russian-political-parties-in-1905.pdf


http://www.wavcott.org.uk/revisionsite/history/russiafactions.html
	Bolsheviks
	The Bolsheviks were the more hard-line wing of the Social Democratic party. They believed in fast change, and disliked the idea of working together with other parties or more centrist organisations. They split from the Mensheviks in 1903, and were led by Vladimir Lenin. They kept a much lower profile than the Mensheviks or SRs until 1917, when Lenin's personal charisma and the ruthless Bolshevik leadership managed to turn the situation to their advantage and gain military power. They managed to re-split the Mensheviks, gaining members such as Alexandra Kollontai and Leon Trotsky, and later took control of the government, becoming the core of the governance of Communist Russia under Lenin as (essentially) a dictator. 


a guess: the splits meant to filter out those not loyal to the Okhrana? (or "Holy Brotherhood" or whatever you want to call them.)

	...Mensheviks
	The Mensheviks were the slightly less hardline of the Social Democrat factions. They believed in a gradual transition towards a socialist state, and were more positive about democracy and working with the Kadets and SRs than Lenin's Bolshevik faction. Led by Julius Martov, they played a major role in the transitional governments of 1917, supporting Kerensky. Later that year they split again with some members returning to join the Bolshevik faction.

	...Socialist Revolutionaries
	The Socialist Revolutionaries were the main socialist faction in Russia from 1900 to 1917. Their radical stance on reform, redistributing land to the peasants and removing the Tsar, made them very popular with the peasantry. The SRs were also violent at times, sometimes killing 500 or so people in a year for being opposed to their cause. The SRs were a major faction in the transitional government and won the elections of 1917 with huge peasant support. The Bolsheviks, who had taken power from the transitional government a few days earlier, shut the SRs out and dissolved the assembly. The right of the SRs supported the whites in the civil war, the left supported the reds; others supported neither side. SRs included Alexander Kerensky and Victor Chernov.

Fontanka book:


	...With great zest for his work, Beletsky plunged into matters that
previous directors preferred to avoid. He personally controlled the
most important secret agents, went forth into the streets of Petersburg
to meet with informers and agents in conspiratorial apartments, and
dictated instructions to them. Having studied all the fine points of the
revolutionary underground, and being personally acquainted with the
leaders of the main parties, Beletsky employed the ancient principle of
divide and conquer. He staked a great deal on exploiting the schism
between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, although subsequent
development showed that isolating the Bolshevik party had a quite
different result to the one the director of the Department of Police
anticipated.

	Beletsky's Malinovsky operation was the result of the Okhranka's
policy to widen the divisions in the Russian Social Democratic Workers'
party and thereby weaken its ability to lead the opposition against the
government. By 1910 the Okhranka believed that it had broken the
terrorist wing of the Socialist Revolutionary party. The secret agency
had made possible this triumph and Beletsky in 1912 came up with
the idea of using the method of infiltration - which had been success-
ful against the illegal SRS - against the Social Democrats operatin
within a legal organization, the State Duma. His chosen agent would
be Roman Malinovsky.

	Malinovsky, a Russified Pole, had a criminal record. He had served
a prison term for burglary from 1899 to 1902, and, upon release, had
joined the workers' movement and risen rapidly through its ranks. He
became a founder of the St Petersburg Metal Workers' Union and, in
1907, its secretary. Malinovsky attracted a following among the work-
ers because of his fiery speaking style and bold attacks against the
government. He was one of those figures in the early twentieth century
who sensed the influence of the masses, developed the qualities of a
spell-binding orator, and knew how to sway the thinking of a large
audience.


	Following his term in jail, Malinovsky joined another organization,
the Okhranka. Okhranka agents knew a lot about him and told him
that they understood that he was hardly a believing revolutionary, but
rather a tribune of the people who sought acclaim. Beletsky planned
to further Malinovsky's true ambition for public attention and influ-
ence. After a period of reflection, Malinovsky agreed to serve as a
secret agent. 16 His rise as police agent paralleled his upward climb in
the Metal Workers' Union. The value of his reports soon vaulted
Malinovsky to the status of a privileged agent. He was permitted to
inform on his comrades directly by telephone rather than at meetings
in conspiratorial apartments. The Okhranka had so much confidence
in him that it did not subject him to the periodic psychological assess-
ments that controlling officers undertook during a debriefing. The
Okhranka scrupulously protected Malinovsky and carried out the
arrests of those he denounced with great care in order to avoid com-
promising him. Eventually, to protect his connection with the St Peters-
burg Okhranka, the police exiled him from the city to avoid exposure.


	...The
Okhranka came up with a fresh idea for the use of its agent: Mali-
novsky was to run for election to a deputy's seat in the State Duma
as a representative of a workers' curia in Moscow; the Okhranka
intended to make certain that he won the election. Beletsky says that
A.P. Martynov, the new chief of the Moscow Okhranka, first raised
the idea with him in 1912 as the elections approached for the Fourth
State Duma. A.T. Vassilyev, who would later be the last chief of the
Okhranka, said that this "trifling affair" was entirely the idea of
Beletsky. 19
No matter who thought of the idea, Beletsky liked it; but, before
going ahead, he first sought approval from his superiors: "I spoke by
telephone with Zoltarev [vice-minister of the interior].


what, is rigging elections supposed to be a groundbreaking idea for them?

	New Lights on the Russian Revolution

	June 14, 1919

	...Mr. Spargo traces the intricate history of the Russian revolutionary parties and shows how the Socialists in 1902 slit in two, the majojrity (Bolsheveki) following Lenin, and the minority (Mensheviki) following Plechanov. At first the Bolsheviki were nurst by the Czar, later by the Kaiser. The most violent of the Bolshevik leaders in the Duma, Malinovsky, a close friend of Lenin, turned out to be a police spy and *provocateur*, and his fiery speeches attacking the Government and the bourgeoisie were written for him by Beletzky of the Police Department.

	...Ambassador Francis told her that he had offered American troops to Kerensky but the offer was declined as unnecessary. It has been ah rd to understand the actions of the Russian GOvernment previous to the revolution, but it is all explained when we hear that this policy was dictated to Minister Protopopov by the ghost of the murdered Rasputin. Princes Cantacuzene confirms that rumor that the revolution retarded the withdrawal of Russia from the war, for Premir Sturmer was about to make peace with Germany when he was overthrown.

	...The charge that the Bolshevik movement was secretly encouraged by the Russian Government before the war is confirmed by Serge Persky in the latest volume of his journalistic articles, From Nicholas II to Lenin. He has a photograph of notes of a speech delivered by Malinovsky in the Duma which had been OK'd and annotated by the Minister Maarof. Pravda ("Truth"), the official organ of the Bolshevists, was subsidzed by the Okhrana (secret politce), and Lenin himself in 1910 or 1911 had relations with them. When this was exposed Lenin defended himself in the same fashion as when charged with receiving German aid:

		It was not eh Okhrana that made use of us but on the contrary we that made use of the Okhrana. Without doubt the Okhrana has rendered great services to our party without ever obtaining anything from us.


so this says Beletzky wrote Malinovsky's speeches


https://archive.org/stream/fallofthedynasti012755mbp/fallofthedynasti012755mbp_djvu.txt
	A senior police official 
named Stephen Beletsky, who for a while was one of the key figures in the 
band, put Rasputin on the secret payroll of the Okhrana for a salary of 
3000 rubles a month about $800 and with the Czarina's authorization 
assigned an Okhrana general to supervise the starets* personal bodyguard. 


And Beletsky put Rasputin on the Okhrana's payroll


https://books.google.com/books?id=6BAWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209#v=onepage&q&f=false
    Upon assuming the directorship of Fontanka, Beletskii ordered a massive penetration of Russian society by his field bureaus especially among the peasantry, railway workers, high school students and Russia's military and naval forces 'without delay' ...Like Plehve, he wished no nook nor cranny of possible dissent to escape his attention. However, Beletskii was not satisfied with simply spying on society, he wanted to control it as well. The relationship between public opinion (the Duma and the press) and the workers' movement became the focus of Beletskii's experiment in social control.


this says Beletsky ordered the Okhrana to put penetration agents everywhere, but it seems like they were doing that earlier

	...Fontanka devised a stategy to manipulate the Bolshevik movement into disrupting moderate social democracy. Bolshevism by its very nature offered the perfect vehicle for this strategy. Historians have noted that the decision to adopt this strategy was a grossly ill-considered one. After all what did Beletskii and the Special Section accomplish? As Laura Engelstein and Victoria Bonnell (among others) have pointed out, Fontanka's strategy ensured the demise of moderate social democracy in Russia by producing frustration and anger amongst young workers, the potential leaders of their class. Beletskii's strategy drove these young men and women into the arms of the radical intelligentsia, who promised that by rejecting moderation in favour of extremism the workers would attain the economic and political goals they so desired. The end result contributed, therefore, to placing Lenin and his Bolsheviks at the forefront of the labour movement.


also says Beletsky had the strategy of promoting the Bolsheviks

After consulting with Beletsky, Malinovsky's criminal record was expunged so he could run for Duma. The Okhrana also arrested his rival candidates.

Chernomasov also started spreading rumors that Malinovksy was an Okhrana agent, which is interesting since Chernomasov was an Okhrana agent

Malinovksy also loaned money to Lenin

claims Lenin was compromised by Malinovsky

Then Malinovsky suddenly resigns the Duma May 8 1914 after they give him a bunch of money

then he got imprisoned by the Germans

Chairman. - You again dodge. This is what I'm talking about.

Beletsky. - What I am reporting, I confirm; you see that I do not shy away from the truth. - A certain period of time passed, which enabled Malinovsky to make amends. In the party environment, it is a fairly large figure. He is a gifted and capable person. I and Vissarionov had a meeting with him and knew in this way what wishes are coming from the Bolshevik Party, which we had a lot among the Social-Democratic Party; Malinovsky's information enabled the police department to check information [ 281 ] foreign agents; then - give informative reports on the guiding principles of the future work of these parties; then, through it, break up what could somehow disturb the government. He treated with such confidence that some of the letters he gave to the police department in copies gave us the opportunity to know about the tasks of the party. Finally, he was sent to Switzerland by the faction, to the party congress. If you remember, it was a big congress of Bolshevik and Menshevik organizations, its task was to merge propaganda for common work. Malinovsky was instructed that he, if possible, contribute to the division of parties. They used it to know what was happening among the anarchists, among the Social Democrats, and not only in the Bolshevik party, but also in the Mensheviks, because these parties were somehow connected; for the Minister of Internal Affairs, this information is of great importance.

Chairman. "So you and Vissarionov had meetings with Malinovsky, according to instructions, in a safe house?"

Beletsky. - The meetings took place in different places. At a secret apartment, rarely, they were arranged for an official Kurochkin. And we met with Malinovsky in different places, so as not to pay attention; in separate rooms of the restaurant, etc.

Oldenburg. - Tell me, did it occur to the police department that holding a high state institution, such as the State Duma, a state criminal belonging to the Bolshevik party, a person with a tainted past, is an act of provocation?

Beletsky. - I myself said about Malinovsky, without waiting for your question. I considered myself guilty of what happened.

Chairman. - Do you think this is a provocation?

Beletsky. "I consider myself guilty." I'm aware, because it always reproached me. 



so "Malinovsky was instructed that he, if possible, contribute to the division of parties." How exactly did that happen? should look at what he actually did


Chairman. - Ie. has the right to supply the printing house only with the permission of the leading officers? The state in the community, as you know, being a lawyer, is a crime from the point of view of the law. Even passive state, for example, silent participation in meetings, is a sign of belonging to the community. This is the common interpretation. Eighth paragraph statement says, "but if you want something else to do, then do it with the approval in each case of the governing officer."

Beletsky.- But the governing officer he would not give this permission, since he had instructions from the Police Department, that such cases are cases of provocation. For example, we had an employee Malinovsky, a member of the State Duma. Performances you yourself know it well. Belonging to the Bolshevik Party, he was distinguished oratorical talent and represent quite a large figure. On his orders were placed - to speak from the pulpit of the State Duma. What he has to say from the pulpit of the Duma, from the point of view of the party? The party can give him directions; but he who is watching, can indicate that it did not have the character of what we call a provocation.

Chairman.- I've even do not understand anything. You, as the director of the Police Department, you know that Malinowski speech from the pulpit of the State Duma were the performances are very extreme, very high propaganda pressure. Malinowski, a secret agent of the police department, urged the country to revolution. Specify in this example, that you have taken yourself, what is the impact of those they lead?

Beletsky. - If you read Malinowski speech verbatim record, you will see that it is up to the last limit, before being called up, he never reached.

Chairman. - Do you think that can be even more extreme?

Beletsky. - From the point of view of the party, at the very moment when those requirements, which came from the Central Committee, he had to play a big role. [ 278 ]

Chairman. - Do you take the courage to assert that the role of its leader was moderating?

Beletsky. - Of course I do.

Chairman. - Was it desirable for the police department that a person should follow the revolutionary hierarchy, that he would rise higher and higher, to the center of the revolutionary party?

Beletsky. - In terms of only awareness.

Chairman. - You know that in order to move in this hierarchy, you need to have well-known merits before the party. So, from your point of view, the employee was the more valuable, the more he had merits before the party, the closer he stood to the center?

Beletsky. - Of course. 



Beletsky edited, censored Malinovksy's speeches, but Malinovksy called for revolution. Beletsky apparently claims that he just wanted Malinovksy to gain street cred with the Bolsheviks and that he didn't encourage Malinovsky to call for revolution.



Ivanov. - Do you know whether Malinovsky's speech was censored in the State Duma?

Beletsky. - I reported that the speech was composed by the party, and he was given. We looked through it, and if it did not answer our direction, it was agitational and exciting, we discussed the question whether it is possible for him to speak or not. The party can confirm that there have been cases when he refused. [ 286 ]

Chairman. "So, the speeches he pronounced went through censorship?"

Beletsky. - Sometimes, he was presented with requests, and he had to answer from himself, in addition to instructions. But, in most cases, the content of the speeches, especially on the budget, was known.

Chairman. "Was your order to Malinovsky to separate the single faction of the Social-Democrats?"

Beletsky. "I confess that the whole task of my leadership was to prevent the Party from joining up." I acted on the principle of " divide et impera ". [1] 



says he was big on splitting the Social Democrats



Schegolev. - You mentioned that the Bolshevik current had agents in Moscow and Petrograd.

Beletsky. - The regional agency was especially in Moscow and Petrograd. In Petrograd there were leading circles. Party of Social-Democrats. in my time was very good, that's why Malinowski was important to us in terms of broad, general, managerial coverage. In general, the Social-Democratic party. was covered by agents or investigative agencies of the Department quite widely. In the party s.-r. it was hardest to penetrate; she had the least number of good employees, so she was lightly and abroad, because there was a police officer of the department and Burtsev, who exposed us, beat us with our weapons very often; To translate abroad one of the local leaders was very difficult; The party was conspiratorial, the least of which were in communication with each other; Party correspondence did not come across very much, but the parties of the Social-Democrats. and the Cadets. they wrote a lot, and their correspondence did not escape the search authorities. 



Beletsky says Social Democrat were easier to infiltrate

	As always, to Lenin a gain for the faction was equivalent to a 
gain for “our Party” and for “the revolution.” Whether he was right 
in calculating that the split in the Duma was a gain, or whether the 
police were right in thinking it a loss to the revolutionary move- 
ment, we must leave to the reader to decide as he considers the 
events of the year 1917.

	...Information received from political agents points to a 
tendency recently exhibited within the ranks of the Russian 
Social Democratic Party toward the unification of the differ- 
ent factions ... In view of the exceptional gravity of this 
intention and the undesirabilify of its taking place, the 
Police Department considers it necessary to . . . impress 
upon their secret agents the necessity for participating in 
the various Party conferences, there to insist, firmly and 
convincingly, upon the utter impossibility of any such 
fusion, particularly the fusion of the Rolsheviki and the 
Mensheviki. [Russian text in Rabochaya Gazeta , April, 1917; 
English text in Kerensky: The Crucifixion of Liberty , John 
Day, 1934, p. 246; also in Gankin and Fisher: The Bolshe-

Chairman. - In a year more extreme members of the party were planted in the dock. We are interested in the opposite situation, in connection with the Malinovsky case.

Beletsky. - From the affairs of the police department you will see that we, as practitioners, were more interested not in the ideology of which the Menshevik organizations were representatives, but those who exercised; We were interested in the Bolshevik Party and its tasks; if they sometimes came across such cases, then this accident was; I will not say that it was a system. No, my only desire was not to allow these two currents to unite in one


I think Beletsky is claiming he didn't care about what his agents of influence were saying, only that the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks split

http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSokhrana.htm
	The Okhrana also recruited members of illegal organization. as paid informers. In 1912 over 26,000 people in Russia were receiving money from the Okhrana. The average informer received 100 rubles a month, a sum that was well above the average industrial wage at the time. Evno Azef, Okhrana's leading undercover agent, was paid over 2000 rubles a month.

	By John Lewis-Stempel

	...Alas for Nicholas II, he did not inherit his father's iron will or his political shrewdness. Nicholas II preferred (and this is almost endearing) to play happy families rather than attend to affairs of the police state. When he was at his desk, his indecision was final. His impressionability was legendary. The most powerful man in Russia, the joke had it, was the last man to have spoken to the Tsar.


Nicolas II = Donald Trump?


	Make that the "last woman". He was under the thumb of his wife, Alexandra, who hailed from the insignificant German duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her new position as Empress of all Russians went to her head. Writing in 1905 she opined: "The emperor, unfortunately, is weak, but I am not and I intend to be firm." The Lady Macbeth of Russia encouraged her husband's worst trait: His belief in a God-given right to rule.


wife gave him bad advice?


	...A Socialist Revolutionary of this persuasion threw a bomb into Plevhe's carriage. Almost his dying advice was: "What we need to hold Russia back from revolution is a small, victorious war." Russia got its war.

	It provoked a conflict with Japan over who controlled Manchuria. The Russo-Japanese War 1904-5 was relatively small, although it was anything but victorious for St Petersburg. Nicholas II called the Japanese "makaki", meaning monkeys. They made a monkey out of him, annihilating the Imperial navy at Tsushima.

	Father Gapon, with the financial support of Colonel Motojiro Akashi of the Imperial Japanese Army[17] organised the Assembly of Russian Factory and Mill Workers of St. Petersburg, which was also patronized by the Department of the Police and the St. Petersburg Okhrana (secret police). The Assembly's objectives were to defend workers' rights and to elevate their moral and religious status. He was the person to lead the industrial workers to the capital of Russia during the year 1905.

	...After the October Manifesto, before the end of 1905, Gapon returned to Russia and resumed contact with the Okhrana.

Gapon, marching in front of the procession, was carrying a cross, and a number of the workers were holding icons and portraits of the Tsar...

	We had already reached the Alexander Garden, on the other side of which lay the Winter Palace Square, when we heard the sound of bugles, the signal for the cavalry to charge. The marchers came to a halt, uncertain as to what the bugles meant and unable to see what was happening.

	In front, on the right, was a detachment of police, but since they showed no signs of hostility, the procession began moving again. Just then however, a detachment of cavalry rode out...The first volley was fired in the air, but the second was aimed at the crowd, and a number of people fell to the ground. Panic-stricken, the crowd turned and began running in every direction. They were now being fired on from behind...I cannot describe the horror I felt at that moment. It was quite clear the authorities had made a terrible mistake, they had totally misunderstood the intentions of the crowd...the workers went to the palace without any evil intent. They sincerely believed that when they got there they would kneel down and the Tsar would come out and meet them or at least appear on the balcony."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky
	Kerensky's father was the teacher of Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), and members of the Kerensky and Ulyanov families were friends. 


ties between his family and Lenin's


	...Kerensky joined the Narodnik movement and worked as a legal counsel to victims of the Revolution of 1905. At the end of 1904, he was jailed on suspicion of belonging to a militant group. Afterwards he gained a reputation for his work as a defence lawyer in a number of political trials of revolutionaries.


was a lawyer for some Russian revolutionaries. Arrested at one point.


	...In 1912, Kerensky became widely known when he visited the goldfields at the Lena River and published material about the Lena Minefields incident.


maybe means something? might be an incident they would want to have exploited.


	...In the same year, Kerensky was elected to the Fourth Duma as a member of the Trudoviks, a moderate, non-Marxist labour party founded by Alexis Aladin that was associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and joined a Freemason society uniting the anti-monarchy forces that strived for the democratic renewal of Russia.


In with secret societies I guess.

Was also in Duma while Okhrana trying to manipulate politics (e.g. "split social democrats", whatever that means). He involved with that in any way?


	...In response to bitter resentments held against the imperial favorite Grigori Rasputin in the midst of Russia's failing effort in World War I, Kerensky, at the opening of the Duma on 2 November 1916, called the imperial ministers "hired assassins" and "cowards", and alleged that they were "guided by the contemptible Grishka Rasputin!"


Same thing with drawing attention to Okhrana ops


	...Shortly after the February Revolution of 1917, a group of soldiers were ordered by Kerensky to re-bury the corpse at an unmarked spot in the countryside, but the truck broke down or was forced to stop because of the snow on Lesnoe Road outside of St. Petersburg. It is likely the corpse was incinerated (between 3 and 7 in the morning) in the cauldrons of the nearby boiler shop[17][18][19] of the Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University, including the coffin, without leaving a single trace.[20] Anything that had to do with Rasputin disappeared permanently.


the fck is going on here

Rasputin lives?


	...When the Soviet passed a resolution prohibiting its leaders from joining the government, Kerensky delivered a stirring speech at a Soviet meeting. Although the decision was never formalised, he was granted a de facto exemption and continued acting in both capacities.


Soviets give him a pass?


	...Kerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandates and handing over control to revolutionary inclined "soldier committees" instead; the abolition of the death penalty; and allowing revolutionary agitators to be present at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander-in-chief Kerensky as "persuader-in-chief."


iirc responsible for the "democratization of the army," which went hand-in-hand with Lenin's "revolutionizing" the army and the German Foreign Ministry's "propagandizing" the army.


	...On 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of Ukraine's autonomy. Following the July Days unrest in Petrograd and suppression of the Bolsheviks, Kerensky succeeded Prince Lvov as Russia's Prime Minister. Following the Kornilov Affair, an attempted military coup d'état at the end of August, and the resignation of the other ministers, he appointed himself Supreme Commander-in-Chief as well.


how did it end up that he became Prime Minister after the Kerensky push?


	...Furthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of "no enemies to the left" greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or "voyenka" of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets.


left the Bolsheviks unopposed?


	...His arrest of Lavr Kornilov and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the White movement.


should review what he did here--understandable why coup happened, but what did he do afterward? sack any good generals?


	...During the Kornilov Affair, Kerensky had distributed arms to the Petrograd workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. On 6–7 November [O.S. 25–26 October] 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city.


did he arm the Bolshevis for the Kornilov affair?

ends up pissing off officers in army, public at large, empowering Bolshevisks vs. army and in general, then arming them.


	...Kerensky narrowly escaped, and he spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in France. 


how did he escape?


	...During the Russian Civil War he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the White Movement.

	...After the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Kerensky offered his support to Joseph Stalin.


about sums him up


	...spent much of his time at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California, where he both used and contributed to the Institution's huge archive on Russian history, and where he taught graduate courses. He wrote and broadcast extensively on Russian politics and history. His last public speech was delivered at Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1967.

Kerensky's father helped Lenin get into school, vouched for him?


https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.276141/2015.276141.Three-Who_djvu.txt
	But, among 
the colleagues of the deceased school inspector, Ilya Nikolaevich, 
there was at least one honorable exception who stood by the family. 
Feodor Kerensky (father of that Kerensky who will play a large 
role in our story) was the director of the g ymnazia of Simbirsk, 
instructor in literature and Latin, and headmaster of the graduating 
class in which, at the moment Alexander was hung, his younger 
brother, Vladimir, was completing his high-school studies. Even 
while scandalized whispers still remarked the uses to which Alex- 
ander had put his gold medal ( according to sister Anna, Kerensky 
received a reproof from his superiors for having given the medal 
to one so unworthy), the director had the decency and courage 
to award the gold medal once more to an Ulyanov for excellence 
in studies. He advised with Lenin’s mother on the boys future, 
suggesting that Vladimir apply to the University of Kazan rather 
than to that of one of the two capital cities, and that she accompany 
him to Kazan as a safeguard for his good conduct. Setting aside 
any fear of what might come of praising the brother of a would-be 
assassin of the Tsar, he wrote the following recommendation to 
help young Vladimir Ilyich get into the university: 

	Very gifted, always neat and industrious, Ulyanov was 
first in all subjects and, upon completing his studies, re- 
ceived the gold medal as the most deserving pupil in abil- 
ity, progress and conduct. Neither in the school nor outside 
of it, has a single instance been observed when he has given 
cause for dissatisfaction by word or deed to the school 
authorities and teachers. [A white lie, this, for Vladimir 
had gotten into trouble for ridiculing his French teacher!] 
His mental and moral instruction has always been well 
looked after, first by both his parents, and, after the death 
of his father in 1886, by his mother alone, who devoted all 
her attention to the upbringing of her children. Religion 
and discipline were the basis of this upbringing, the fruits 
of which are apparent in Ulyanov's behavior. Looking more 
closely at Ulyanov's character and private life, I have had 
occasion to note a somewhat excessive tendency towards 
isolation and reserve, a tendency to avoid contact with 
acquaintances, and even with the best of his schoolfellows 
outside of school hours. Ulyanov's mother intends to be 
with him throughout his university career. 

	Even the mild stricture on his excessive isolation and reserve 
(which incidentally confirms what his sister Anna records about his 
lack of close friends) was intended to convince the authorities 
that the boy lacked the qualities which might make him into a ring- 
leader and troublemaker. 

	At first glance, the above document does not seem to have any- 
thing remarkable about it. Why should an innocent youngster 
suffer for the crimes of an elder brother? Why not be rated on his 
own merits? Why deny him a gold medal merely because the pre- 
vious winner in the same family had sold his to finance a conspiracy 
against the Tsar? But it is well to remember that in Medieval Eng- 
land, and to some extent in pre-nineteenth century Russia, the 
blood of whole families was regarded as “attainted” if one of their 
members was guilty of treason. And in the Soviet Union today, far 
from having declined, the doctrine of family responsibility has re- 
ceived unheard-of extension and legal codification. 2 In order to 
see in its true perspective Director Kerensky's act on behalf of the 
lad who was one day to become the leading antagonist of Keren- 
sky's own son, we need only try to imagine an official of present- 
day Russia writing such a letter concerning the younger brother of 
one who had plotted to assassinate Stalin! 


could mean something. Possibly, the Okhrana were interested in him since they had executed his brother.

kornilov affair also suspicious

apparently Kerensky ordered Kornilov to attack the Petrograd Soviet


from Henderson book on Burtsev:

	Burtsev had managed to obtain several excerpts from Kornilov’s own ‘testimony’ written for the benefit of Shablovsky’s commission shortly after his arrest.41 These, he published in The Common Cause under the heading ‘Kornilov’s Explanatory Note’ and, over the next few days, supplemented them with copies of the telegraph exchange which had taken place between Kornilov and Kerensky and other documents of relevance. In so doing he provided the public for the first time with a different explanation of events, showing that the accused had, in fact, acted in full agreement with the government and arguing that there never had been a mutiny or a plot.42 Burtsev demanded that the Premier apologize in person and, judging by the thousands of signatures his newspaper collected in support of his stance, the case he made was a convincing one.


Then Kerensky armed the Bolsheviks to attack Kornilov and arrested Kornilov

https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1917/10/04-2.htm
	Who Were They ?

	Who were Kornilov's advisers and inspirers? To whom did he confide his conspiratorial designs in the first place?

	[list names]


and Bolsheviks wanted to exploit it for some kind of purge of the military, strengthen their fighting force


------

	The liberal-patriotic weekly Petrograd Gazette, for example, splashed his portrait over a whole page under the banner headline: ‘Unmasker of Secret Police and Provocateurs’, with the following brief report: ‘V. L. Burtsev, the famous writer and political activist, is renowned for exposing the Azefovshchina so zealously cultivated by Stolypin. Currently, by order of the Provisional Government, Burtsev is systematizing the affairs of the secret police, the Gendarmerie, and the Department of the Police.’3 And indeed, with every passing day, the Komissiia Burtseva (Burtsev Commission), as it became known, would emerge from its labours in the archives with the scalp of yet another traitorous revolutionary, student or journalist. But evidently, such successes did not find favour with Kerensky, the new Minister of Justice, who called Burtsev’s reliability into question believing he was simply not cut out for such systematic duties. Within three days of his appointment, Kerensky was already attempting to undermine the new commissioner, writing to Burtsev’s former co-editor Pavel Shchegolev and others, asking them to bypass Burtsev, examine the Department of Police documents themselves and report back directly to Kerensky. Indeed, according to Sergei Svatikov, both Kerensky and Shchegolev attempted to prevent Burtsev from gaining access to the police archives.

	...The commission managed to limp on for another three months until mid-June, when Kerensky succeeded in having it replaced by another body under Shchegolev’s official chairmanship.


Kerensky tries to stop Burtsev from uncovering his darkest secret that he is actually an Okhrana spy

	I. The Supreme Investigatory Commission was an alternate name for the Extraordinary Investigatory Commission (ChSK), which the Provisional Government established in March 1917 to consider whether former tsarist officials had violated the law in their political activities. It ceased to meet after December 1917.



any other source on Kerensky trying to oust Burtsev? is interesting.



author of Burtsev book says this was Kerensky's motivation:


	...The frostiness which had arisen during the first meeting between Kerensky and Burtsev in the Trubetskoy Bastion some two years earlier had evidently not thawed.


but according to Henderson's Ph.d thesis:

https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/.../1/HENDERSONVladimirBurtsev2008.pdf


	...However, at the outbreak of war in 1914 he unexpectedly issued a call to all revolutionary and opposition parties to reach a compromise with the Russian government, so as to defend their homeland rather than betray it, and then announced his intention to return home, declaring his full support for both the government's domestic and foreign policies. However, on crossing the border he was immediately arrested, imprisoned in the Peter and Paul fortress and then sent into exile to the village of Monastyrskoe, in Turukhansk, Western Siberia. Following petitions (from, among others, A. F. Kerensky, later to become prime minister in the Provisional Government, and V. A. Maklakov (later Russian ambassador in Paris), he was allowed to return to Petrograd at the end of 1915, having served eighteen months of his sentence.


So this doesn't seem right.

	...ARCHIVES, WITNESSES

	At the end of February - beginning of March 1917, almost simultaneously throughout Russia, fires burned, in which the documents of the Security Departments, the Gendarmerie Directorates, the Police Department and other services of the Ministry of the Interior of the Empire burned. The flame was absorbing priceless documents.

	In the first days of the February Revolution, enraged crowds of metropolitan residents set fire to the District Court building on Liteiny Prospekt and the old prison, the Lithuanian Castle, near the Theater Square. They burned to the ground. The fires broke out in the building of the Police Department on the Fontanka near the Panteleymonovsky Bridge and on Mytninskaya Embankment, where the Petrograd Security Department was smashed and burned. These two buildings with their contents were set on fire intentionally. Many wanted to exterminate the archives of the Security Department and the Special Department of the Police Department, they needed oblivion of the past as a guarantee of future existence.

	"True, here and there the gendarmerie officers managed to destroy lists of provocateurs," wrote the publicist SG Svatikov, "in some places a crowd, instigated by security agents, did not understand the meaning of what was happening, defeated the Security Departments and burned their archives and records. For example, a significant part of the archives of the Petrograd security department perished " [251] .

	All those who left memories of these strange fires of the spring of 1917 believed that their former guards had organized them.

	"Before the building of the Police Department," wrote the well-known archivist V. Maksakov, "huge fires of papers, documents, deeds, photographic cards thrown from the windows burned day and night on the Fontanka and Panteleymonovskaya street. In the room most of the cabinets were hacked, and books, files, individual papers piles covered the floors of a huge building. Some departments, for example, VIII office work, which dealt with cases of combating crime, were completely destroyed. Others suffered considerably. Fortunately, the room in which the Special Section of the Police Department was located did not suffer much. Here were the most valuable materials in the historical sense. They have been preserved almost completely " [252] .

	Someone reported on what was happening on the Fontanka in the Pushkin House of the Academy of Sciences. The indispensable secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Academician SF Oldenburg, was able to obtain several wagons, and an expedition consisting of PE Shchegolev, BL Modzalevsky, tl. A. Kotlyarevsky, A. S. Polyakov, A. A. Shilov, V. P. Semennikov and others, went to save the most valuable archives [253] . All that was saved, on March 3, was loaded into a sleigh and taken to the Vasilievsky Island to the Academy of Sciences. (Some of the saved documents were lost in 1918 when the archives were evacuated to Yaroslavl.) [254]

	In Moscow on March 1, 1917 in the palace along Gnezdnikovsky Lane, 5, bonfires flamed. Documents of the Security Department were burning. Someone wore papers in the bonfires, someone took for a folder, photos, brochures. "It was difficult to understand," wrote Maksakov, "who was more in this crowd," curious or former guards who aspired, as late as possible, to conceal in the fire of fires their traces of participation in the protection of the failed autocratic system. That there were a lot of former guards in the crowd could be seen from the fact that when checking the cases of the "secret police", especially its so-called "secret service department," it was subsequently found out that the lack of mainly personal files of secret employees, "agent notes" such documents, apparently, not accidentally disappeared during the "spontaneous" rout of the "secret police" and police stations.

	On the same day, a group of politicians and historians organized the protection of the documents of the "secret police" and their transportation to Red Square to the Moscow Historical Museum, where the reading room of the museum was adapted to accommodate archival materials " [255] .

	The situation was much worse in the provinces. There, the security offices burned simultaneously with the capital, first of all they destroyed personal affairs of secret employees and normative documents regulating the methods of the political investigation. News of the widespread destruction of the detective institutions of the former empire prompted the Provisional Government to urgently establish a Commission under the Ministry of Justice to liquidate the political affairs of the former Police Department. It was headed by the former Narodovolets VL Burtsev, who paid very little time to the Commission, which left part of the archives in the custody of their former custodians, officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Provisional Government "ordered the protection of police archives only when the official custodians left their posts and when many documents had already been plundered and destroyed" [256] .

	Seeing that the Burtsov Commission is inactive, on March 13, 1917, the Minister of Justice signed a letter with the following content:

	"I propose to Comrade Prosecutor Sluchevsky, PE Shchegolev, VM Zenzinov, NN Myasoyedov and Ensign Znamensky to review in the shortest possible time the documents seized in the Police Department and other institutions at my disposal and the results inform me.

	Minister of Justice AF Kerensky " [257] .

	The Burtsev commission was formally liquidated on June 15, 1917. Five days before its formation, the Provisional Government formed an Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry to investigate the unlawful actions of former ministers and other senior officials of civil, military and naval agencies [258] . In her work constantly participated: the famous Moscow lawyer NK Muraviev (chairman), senators SV Ivanov and SV Zavadsky (deputy chairmen), the chief military prosecutor VA Apushkin, the prosecutor of the Kharkov Chamber of Justice B. N. Smitten, prosecutor of the Moscow District Court LP Olyshev, academician S. F. Oldenburg, prosecutor of the Vilnius Chamber of Judges A. F. Romanov, representative of the State Duma F. I. Rodichev, from the Executive Committee of the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies N. D. Sokolov and the only historian P. Ye. Schegolev. The Commission invited the poet AA Blok to assist the journalist Mikhail Miklashevsky and the writer L. Ya. Gurevich, the scientific editorial staff, and the editorial staff was assisted by Professor E. Tarle. 



Brackman book:

	August 1917 period, the Muraviev Commission had gathered some of the Department of
Police files that it needed for investigation of the most important cases of Okhrana
provocations. In September 1917 the Commission stopped its proceedings because of
Kerensky’s order to evacuate the archives, and its material together with the files of
Okhrana agents were placed in boxes that were sealed and stored in expectation of
evacuation, which, however, did not take place. The files remained in boxes for the next
two years, and at the end of 1919 were transported to Moscow together with the archive
of the Investigative Commission of the Supreme Tribunal



Taylor book:

	On occasion the Okhrana organized escapes and prison breaks to build the “cover” of its agents, and though it clung to the fiction that these were merely passive informants, many of them were agents provocateurs in the most literal sense. Though the investigating committee set up under the Kerensky regime could not find documentary proof that the Okhrana had deliberately instigated street demonstrations and rebellions, there is a wealth of informed testimony that it did so, notably in the great Moscow uprising of 1905 and in similar bloody disorders in Kronstadt and Viborg.


Kerensky couldn't find documentary proof? I wonder why...

	An Extraordinary Investigative Commission for the Investigation of the Unlawful Actions of Former Ministers, Governors and Other Senior Officials of Civil, Military and Naval Departments [1] (BSC) is an extraordinary investigative body established on March 4 (17), 1917 by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution .

	...Nikolai Konstantinovich Muravyov was appointed Chairman of the UCM, with the rights of the Comrade Minister of Justice.

	The commission was divided into three parts: the investigative unit, the supervisory body and the presidium.

	The investigative unit consisted of persons of the judicial department in the number of up to 20 people. These persons carried out investigations, interrogations, inspections, searches in compliance with the rules of the Charter of the Criminal Proceedings. 


	....In total, the commission made 88 interviews and questioned 59 persons, preparing "verbatim records", the editor-in-chief of which was the poet AA Blok , who published his observations on interrogations and records in the form of a book called "The Last Days of Imperial Power" 3] .

	Interrogations of tsarist ministers, generals and dignitaries were conducted in the Winter Palace and in the casemates of the Peter and Paul Fortress . Although the Commission was exclusively legal in nature, the materials were collected immensely, but the course of events did not allow the publication of even a relatively small part of them. The commission did not complete its work before the October Revolution, part of the interrogation was published in 7 volumes in 1924 - 1927 under the title "The Fall of the Tsarist Regime"


and then they stormed the Okhrana HQ and burned their files

	Schegolev wrote about his activity in 1917 in his autobiography as follows [10, p. 119]:

    	In 1917 the revolution again tears me away from historical and literary works and returns again to historical and literary problems. In the first days of March 1917, A.F. Kerensky suggested that I take in my jurisdiction and proceed to the analysis of all those materials that were preserved in the premises of the Police Department at No. 16 Fontanka and made up my own archive of the 3rd branch and a huge production from the moment of occurrence to the current day (1880-1917). This huge material, broken and scattered in the first days of the revolution, carried to different places (to the Academy of Sciences, to the Ministry of Justice), was collected under my leadership and concentrated in one place and was under different names ... 


	About work in the former Schegolev wrote [11, p. 119-120]:

    	The initiative for the renewal of [the journal's edition] was mine; initial composition of the editorial board: I, V.L. Burtsev and V.V. Vodovozov, who replaced V.Ya. Bogucharsky, who died in 1915. Burtsev, engaged in political speeches and developing the propaganda of war in his newspaper "The Common Cause" until the victorious end, almost did not engage in the affairs of the "Bygone", after the October Revolution he completely disregarded the editing and left in January 1918 [sic!] From Soviet Russia. And V.V. Water carriers; he was succeeded by E.V. Tarle, but he worked for a short time (1918 year [sic!]). In fact, I did all the editing work, and after the departure of Tarle [at the end of 1917] and until recently I remained the sole editor.

	While Lenin was exploring these bizarre plans to travel to Russia, Alexandra Kollontai was 
planning to leave Norway for Petersburg.  She had cabled him a request for “directives” 
(“Just imagine thinking about ‘directives’ from here,” commented Lenin with mock wonder) 
and now on the nineteenth he wired her the line she was to take in Russia :  “Our tactics :  No 
trust in and no support of the new government.  Kerensky is especially suspect.  No 
rapprochement with other parties. . . .”
Lenin’s comrades found it strange that he should attach such importance to Alexander 
Kerensky, who was only a junior minister in the new government.  Other men seemed far 
more formidable.  But even then Lenin seemed to sense that in the conflict that faced him 
when eventually he got to Petersburg, Kerensky would be his most critical adversary.  It was 
a belief that was marked with historical irony, for out of all the territory of the Russias, 
Kerensky also came from the little Volga town of Simbirsk.  His father had even taught 
Lenin in school, and after the death of Lenin’s father—according to an assertion by 
Kerensky—he became the family guardian.
Kerensky, who was ten years younger than Lenin, was in the right wing of the SR party.


book says Lenin was interested in Kerensky during his train ride, but author is sketchy

	After the hanging of Alexander Ulyanov, they (naturally) started looking very closely at the Ulyanov family. Can you find a better undercover agent than a close relative of a revolutionary martyr? Vladimir filled the bill very nicely. Age 17, on the doorstep of college, very ambitious, and very vulnerable. The circumstances of his recruitment and all of his subsequent relationship with the police were dutifully recorded in his police file, which in 1917 fell into the hands of the Provisional Government of Russia, formed after the abolition of the monarchy. Incredibly, it was Prime Minister Kerensky’s decision not to use this explosive file against Lenin during the shaky interregnum of 1917, for reasons I will reveal in a later entry… After the Bolsheviks came to power, the file was destroyed.


this true? first impression is not to believe it.

	Most of Lenin's supporters thought that he should prove his innocence in court, and did not believe that the German government had spent huge sums, more than 50 million gold marks, to finance BOlshevik propaganda. Only the very narrow circle of people around Parvus and Ganetsky and the Politburo members Zinoviev, Kamanev and Stalin knew about the German money, and they advised Lenin not to risk a trial. Lenin expressed the view that there would not be an open court. Stalin agreed, suggesting that the arresting officers would kill Lenin on the way to prison. That very moment Elana Stasova, Lenin's confidante, came in and said that a rumor had been spread that Lenin 'according to the documents of the police department, was a *provocateur*'. Everybody fell silent. Stasova's announcement 'produced an incredibly strong impression on Lenin A nervous shudder ran over his face, and he declared with the utmost determination that he must got to jail.' Lenin's determination was short-lived, however, and he decided to go into hiding.


Brackman kindof agrees. I guess he's saying Lenin's reaction lends credence to the rumors of a damming police file.


for Lenin's reaction, Brackman cites Tolstoy's book on Stalin and this book:

https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=https://www.e-reading.club/book.php%3Fbook%3D1004632&prev=search


does seem to confirm the account of the rumor and Lenin's reaction:

	Их нет уже в живых. Остались только наброски воспоминаний, записки.

	Орджоникидзе:"Юнкера рыщут повсюду — ищут Ленина. Разговоры: "Удрал к Вильгельму", "Найдешь ты его, как бы не так".
	Таврический дворец. Здесь только и говорят о нашем выступлении, о том, что у нас в организации не все обстоит благополучно. Так говорят левые с.-р., так говорят даже некоторые довольно видные большевики. В рабочих районах минутное смущение, но оно живо проходит. Среди солдат — павловцев и измайловцев довольно ясно слышны голоса: "Подвели, мы не знали, что большевики германские шпионы".
	Ленина ищут, но не находят. Некоторые наши товарищи ставят вопрос о том, что Ленину нельзя скрываться, он должен явиться. "Иначе у партии не будет возможности оправдаться перед широкими массами".
	"Вождю партии брошено тяжкое обвинение, он должен предстать перед судом и оправдать себя и партию". Так рассуждали очень многие видные большевики.
	…Направляемся к Ленину, он должен быть на квартире у Николая Гурьевича Полетаева (бывший депутат Государственной думы, рабочий Путиловского завода), кажется на 8-й Рождественской. Торопимся, так как в Таврическом — упорные слухи, что Полетаев, по данным архива департамента полиции, провокатор. Спешим к Ильичу, надо его предупредить об этом, надо перевести его оттуда, не то могут нагрянуть на квартиру Николая Гурьевича и там застать Ильича. Приходим — его уже нет.
	Жена Полетаева сообщила, что Ленин перешел от них на квартиру Аллилуева. Сергея Яковлевича мы знали многие годы. У нас на Кавказе он был одним из первых социал-демократов. Неоднократно руководил политическими забастовками в Главных железнодорожных мастерских в Тифлисе и на Бакинских нефтяных промыслах. Приходилось бывать и на петроградской квартире Аллилуева — на 10-й Рождественской.
	Ленин и Крупская там. Не успели мы сесть, как вошли Ногин и В. Яковлева. Пошли разговоры о том, надо ли Владимиру Ильичу явиться и дать себя арестовать. Ногин довольно робко высказался за то, что надо явиться и перед гласным судом дать бой. Ильич заметил, что никакого гласного суда не будет, Сталин добавил: "Юнкера до тюрьмы не доведут, убьют по дороге". Ленин, по всему видно, тоже против, но немного смущает его Ногин.
	Как раз в это время заходит Елена Стасова. Она, волнуясь, сообщает, что в Таврическом дворце вновь пущен слух, якобы по документам архива департамента полиции Ильич — провокатор! Эти слова произвели на Ленина невероятно сильное впечатление. Нервная дрожь перекосила его лицо, и он со всей решительностью заявил, что надо ему сесть в тюрьму, Ильич объявил это нам тоном, не допускающим возражений".

	Крупская:"Седьмого июля мы вместе с Марией Ильиничной были на квартире Аллилуевых… Это как раз момент колебания у Ильича. Он приводил доводы за необходимость явиться на суд. Мария Ильинична горячо возражала ему. "Мы с Григорием решили явиться, пойди скажи об этом Каменеву", — попросил меня Ильич. Я заторопилась. "Давай попрощаемся, — остановил меня Владимир Ильич, — может, не увидимся уж". Мы обнялись.
	Вечером у нас на Широкой был обыск. Обыскивали только нашу комнату. Был какой-то полковник и еще какой-то военный в шинели на белой подкладке. Они взяли из стола несколько записок, какие-то мои документы. Спросили, не знаю ли я, где Ильич, из чего я заключила, что он не объявился",

	Орджоникидзе:"Меня и Ногина посылают в Таврический дворец для переговоров с членом президиума ЦИК и Петроградского Совета Анисимовым об условиях содержания Ильича в тюрьме. Мы должны были добиться от него гарантий, что Ленин не будет растерзан озверевшими юнкерами. Надо было добиться, чтобы Ильича посадили в Петропавловку (там гарнизон был наш), или же, если посадят в "Кресты", добиться абсолютной гарантии, что он не будет убит и предстанет перед гласным судом. В случае утвердительного ответа, Анисимов под вечер на автомобиле подъезжает к условному подъезду на 8-й Рождественской, где его встречает Ленин, и оттуда везет Ильича в тюрьму, где, конечно, его прикончили бы, если бы этой величайшей, преступной глупости суждено было совершиться.
	Мы с Ногиным явились в Таврический и вызвали Анисимова. Рассказали ему о решении Ильича и потребовали абсолютной гарантии. На Петропавловку он не согласился. Что касается гарантии в "Крестах", заявил, что, конечно, будут приняты все меры. Я решительно потребовал от него абсолютных гарантий (чего никто не мог дать!), пригрозив, что в случае чего-либо перебьем всех их. Анисимов был рабочий Донбасса. Мне показалось, что его самого охватывает ужас от колоссальной ответственности этого дела. Еще несколько минут, и я заявил ему: "Мы вам Ильича не дадим". Ногин тоже согласился с этим. Спешу обратно на квартиру Аллилуева. При выходе встречаю Луначарского, который утром был в большой панике.
	Анатолий Васильевич поручил мне передать Ленину, чтобы он ни в коем случае не садился в тюрьму, ибо в данный момент в руках коалиции находится власть только формально, фактически же она у корниловцев, а завтра, может быть, и формально перейдет к ним. Это меня очень обрадовало


translates to:

	They are no longer alive. Remained only a sketch of memories, notes.
	
	Ordzhonikidze: "Junkers are scouring everywhere - they are looking for Lenin." Conversations: "I ran away to Wilhelm," "You will find him, as it were not so."
	The Tauride Palace. Here they only talk about our speech, about the fact that in our organization, not everything is going well. This is what the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries say, as even some quite prominent Bolsheviks say. In the working areas, a momentary embarrassment, but it is alive. Among the soldiers - Pavlovians and Izmaylovites - the voices are clearly heard: "They let us down, we did not know that the Bolsheviks were German spies."
	They are looking for Lenin, but they do not find him. Some of our comrades raise the question that Lenin can not hide, he must come. "Otherwise, the party will not have the opportunity to justify itself before the broad masses."
	"The leader of the party is heavily accused, he must stand trial and justify himself and the party." So many prominent Bolsheviks argued.
	... Going to Lenin, he should be at the apartment with Nikolai Gurevich Poletayev (former deputy of the State Duma, worker of the Putilov plant), it seems on the 8th Christmas. We are in a hurry, because in Tavrichesky there are persistent rumors that Poletayev, according to the archive of the police department, is a provocateur. We rush to Ilyich, we must warn him about this, we must transfer him from there, or they might come to Nikolai Gurievich's apartment and find Ilich there. We arrive - it is no longer there.
	Poletaeva's wife reported that Lenin had moved from them to Alliluyev's apartment. We knew Sergei Yakovlevich for many years. He was one of the first Social-Democrats in the Caucasus. He repeatedly directed political strikes at the Main Railway Workshops in Tiflis and the Baku oil fields. I had to visit Alliluyev's Petrograd apartment on the 10th Christmas Day.
	Lenin and Krupskaya are there. We did not have time to sit down, as Nogin and V. Yakovlev entered. Talk about whether Vladimir Ilyich should appear and let himself be arrested. Nogin rather timidly spoke out for having to appear before a public court to fight. Ilyich noticed that there would be no vowel trial, Stalin added: "The Junkers will not be brought to the prison, they will be killed on the way." Lenin, by all accounts, is also against, but Nogin is somewhat embarrassed.
	Just at this time comes Elena Stasova. She, worried, informs that in the Tavrichesky palace rumor is again started, according to the documents of the archive of the police department, Ilyich is a provocateur! These words made an incredibly powerful impression on Lenin. The nervous trembling twisted his face, and he declared with all determination that he should go to prison, Ilyich declared it to us in a tone that did not object. "
	
	Krupskaya: "On July 7, together with Maria Ilyinichna, we were at the apartment of the Alliluyevs ... This is exactly the moment of hesitation in Ilyich, he argued for the need to appear at the trial." Maria Ilyinichna hotly objected to him: "Grigory and I decided to show up, go tell Kamenev about this "Ilyich asked me, I hurried on." Let's say goodbye, "Vladimir Ilyich stopped me," maybe we will not see each other again. "We embraced.
	In the evening we had a search on Shiroka. They searched only our room. There was a colonel and some other military man in a greatcoat on a white lining. They took a few notes from the table, some of my documents. They asked me if I did not know where Ilyich was, from what I concluded that he had not showed up, "
	
	Ordzhonikidze: "Me and Nogin are sent to the Tauride Palace for negotiations with a member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee and the Petrograd Soviet Anisimov about the conditions of Ilyich's detention in jail.We should have secured from him guarantees that Lenin would not be torn to pieces by the brutal Junkers.It was necessary to get Ilyich planted in Petropavlovka (there was our garrison there), or if they put him in the "Crosses", to obtain an absolute guarantee that he will not be killed and will appear before a public court. "If the answer is" Yes ", Anisimov arrives in the evening by car ovnomu entrance on 8th Christmas, where he is met by Lenin, and from there driven by Ilyich in prison, where, of course, it would have killed if this great, criminal stupidity was destined to happen.
	Nogin and I appeared in Tavrichesky and summoned Anisimov. They told him about Ilyich's decision and demanded an absolute guarantee. He did not agree to Petropavlovka. As for the guarantee in the "Crosses", he said that, of course, all measures will be taken. I strongly demanded absolute guarantees from him (which no one could give!), Threatening that in the event of something we would kill all of them. Anisimov was a worker in the Donbas. It seemed to me that he himself was horrified by the colossal responsibility of this affair. A few more minutes, and I told him: "We will not give you Ilich." Nogin also agreed with this. I hasten back to Alliluyev's apartment. At the exit I meet Lunacharsky, who in the morning was in great panic.
	Anatoly Vasilevich instructed me to tell Lenin not to go to jail in any case, for at the moment the power is only formally in the hands of the coalition, in fact it is from the Kornilovites, and tomorrow, perhaps, formally will pass to them. This made me very happy



the part from Trotsky's book (Stalin: an appraisal of the man):


	In her reminiscences Krupskaya states: “On the 7th I visited Ilyich at his quarters in the apartment of the Alliluyevs together with Maria Ilyinichna [Lenin’s sister]. This was just at the moment when Ilyich was wavering. He marshalled arguments in favor of the necessity to appear in court. Maria Ilyinichna argued against him hotly. ‘Gregory [Zinoviev] and I have decided to appear. Go and tell Kamenev about it,’ Ilyich told me. I made haste. ‘Let’s say good-bye,’ Vladimir Ilyich said to me, ’we may never see each other again.’ We embraced. I went to Kamenev and gave him Vladimir Ilyich’s message. In the evening Stalin and others persuaded Ilyich not to appear in court and thereby saved his life.”


Krupskaya says Stalin convinced Lenin not to go to court


	These trying hours were described in greater detail by Ordzhonikidze. “The fierce hounding of our Party leaders began … Some of our comrades took the point of view that Lenin must not hide, that he must appear … So reasoned many prominent Bolsheviks. I met Stalin in the Tauride Palace. We went together to see Lenin …” The first thing that strikes the eye is the fact that during those hours when “a fierce hounding of our Party leaders” was going on, Ordzhonikidze and Stalin calmly meet at the Tauride Palace, headquarters of the enemy, and leave it unpunished.


Trotsky accusing Ordzhonikidze and Stalin of conferring with cops?


	The same old argument was renewed at Alliluyev’s apartment: to surrender or to hide? Lenin supposed that there would be no open trial. More categorical than any other against surrender was Stalin: “The Junkers [military students, equivalent of West Pointers] won’t take you as far as prison, they’ll kill you on the way …” At that moment Stassova appeared and informed them of a new rumor—that Lenin was, according to the documents of the Police Department, a provocateur. “These words produced an incredibly strong impression on Lenin. A nervous shudder ran over his face, and he declared with the utmost determination that he must go to jail.” Ordzhonikidze and Nogin were sent to the Tauride Palace, to attempt to persuade the parties in power to guarantee “that Ilyich would not be lynched … by the Junkers.” But the frightened Mensheviks were seeking guarantees for themselves. Stalin in his turn reported at the Petrograd Conference: “I personally posed the question of making a declaration to Lieber and Anissimov [Mensheviks, members of the Soviet Central Executive Committee], and they replied to me that they could not give guarantees of any kind.” After this feeler in the camp of the enemy, it was decided that Lenin should leave Petrograd and hide securely underground. “Stalin undertook to organize Lenin’s departure.”


so what did Lenin think of the warning from Stasova? cops black-mailing him?

Account from Ordzhonikidze's biography says the rumor was in "Tavrichesky palace"

	"that in the Tavrichesky palace rumor is again started, according to the documents of the archive of the police department, Ilyich is a provocateur!"


but the Trotsky and Brackman tellings don't say that


https://books.google.com/books?id=nnIQ1B25EV8C&pg=PA69
	Elena Stasova usually stood close to the money, ready to snatch it up should the police arrive, for such solicitation of contributions was illegal. The Okhrana, the police agency charged with supressing revolutionaries, in fact knew that the Stasovs were collecting money for the Social Democrats, but was loath to move against them after 1900, because a raid in that year had netted the local Okhrana commander a reprimand from the high-ranking relative of on of the guests.

	Stasova was also very good at maintaining communications between Social-Democratic organizations, both within Russia and abroad, She committed to memory the names (or aliases) of hundreds of people, their addresses, and the addresses of apartments where they could hide from the police. She built up caches of forged passports and other documents. She worked out codes for correspondence, mastered writing in invisible ink, helped people on the run with their disguises, and survived numerous mishaps and catastrophes--such as when she once mistakenly died a comrade's hair green! Practiced at spotting police surveillance, she knew how to transport loads of illegal pamphlets around the city in a briefcase.



http://alexanderartemsakharov.blogspot.com/2011/01/lenins-progress.html
	...Kerensky now decided that the time had finally come to get rid of Lenin once and for all. Through her ubiquitous contacts, Elena Stasova was able to learn that Kerensky was considering releasing Lenin’s lethally compromising file to the press.

	As soon as Lenin heard this, he knew he was as good as dead and he fled from the Russian capital north into Finland. Before fleeing, however, he ventured to strike an outrageous gambit. Through the selfsame Stasova he urged a preemptive release to the press of the documents, in his own possession, suggesting that he was a German agent of influence, subsidized by Kaiser Wilhelm II.

	The bombshell exploded, preempting Kerensky’s own disclosure of the Okhrana file. The press was having a field day, salivating over Lenin’s German ties. Everybody was convinced that this time Lenin was finished for good, but Lenin alone seemed to realize that this was his only chance to survive, and to win the game.


that's an interesting explanation

did get the impression that other agents of influence were trying to emphasize Lenin's German ties over his Okhrana ties.

Would be one explanation for why the press (and apparently the Okhrana) went along with the "German agent" thing and promoted it--if it caught on, it would make any revelation that Lenin was an Okhrana agent seem less credible.

taylor book:

	...The particular tragedy of the Democratic Socialists like Alexander Kerensky, of the liberal monarchists like Paul Milyukov, of the more-or-less enlightened conservatives like Alexander Guchkov, who for several weeks or months had been actively plotting an anti-autocratic coup of some kind—Kerensky in February had publicly called for the elimination of the Czar “by terrorist means if necessary,” and the Chief of Staff General Alexeyev had a plan for arresting the Czarina and forcing a change of government on Nicholas at gun-point—is that before they could act they were thrust into honorary leadership of a ready-made revolution which they had had no hand in organizing.

	...The Duma itself, or at least its principal members, had joined the rebellion on March 11, by defying an Imperial decree of prorogation. Instead of disbanding, the deputies had on the following day set up a so-called Emergency Committee, chaired by the Duma’s President, the portly, Conservative M. V. Rodzianko, and consisting of the chief Progressive Bloc leaders—Milyukov, Lvov, Guchkov, Basil Shulgin, et al—plus a left-wing maverick, the former Revolutionary Socialist Alexander Kerensky. We are so used to thinking of him as the Kerensky of the Russian Revolution, that we tend to forget he was really its Danton. A lean, tense, jerky man with short-cut hair and the sharp beak of a high-minded cormorant, Kerensky, despite his subsequent reputation, had exceptional energy and courage, and he was the greatest soap-box orator in Russia (certainly with Trotsky in America). The situation was made to order for him (and he, alas, for it).

	The revolutionary crowd instinctively drifted to the Duma, the nearest thing to an opposition forum in Czarist Russia, seeking news, inspiration, and instructions. Kerensky was prodigal with all three. He alone of the Duma Committee was in his element receiving the impromptu delegations of battle-stained, disheveled soldiers, of red-eyed, grim-featured workers and of hysterical students who milled around the lobbies of the Tauride Palace, shouting, sweating, gesticulating, brandishing weapons, and spitting on the floor. Between inspirational harangues he would dart into the crowd to rescue with his own hands some elderly, terrified general, countess, or ex-minister whom the revolution had dragged in, like a cat with a crippled bird in its mouth. (Protopopov, found hiding at his tailor’s, was narrowly saved from lynching by Kerensky’s intervention.) Everyone was quaffing down great draughts of raw history, the most intoxicating kind.


Kerensky protecting certain people in the Tsarist regime from revolutionary mobs? would be interesting to see which ones he picked


	...“While the mass of workers and peasants were indifferent to the foreign policies of the Czar and his government,” Kerensky later testified, “the intellectuals, the bourgeoisie and some of the higher-ranking officer-class thought they detected in the foreign and domestic policies of the Czar, and more particularly in the intrigues of the Czarina, a definite tendency to lead the country to its ruin for the sole purpose of concluding a separate peace and an alliance with Germany.”


What's up with this? Kerensky big on attacking/raising suspicious of Germany. Also testified he believed Lenin acted as a German agent.

This intentional? would be an excuse for him to continue the war. He could subscribe to the idea that the Bolsheviks, propagandizing of army, terrorist attacks were by Germany, and so the defeat of Germany would be the only way to stop it. Painting a separate peace as their aims would give him and others around him an excuse not to stop the war. Meanwhile, a separate peace might have been the only way to stop the war for Russia, and Kerensky ignored signs that it was the Okhrana themselves who were responsible for some of the provocations.


	...Oddly enough, the Bolsheviks, though they were better staffed with experienced and uninhibited agitators than most of the revolutionary parties, were not spectacularly successful in these bloodless street battles of ideas, at least when this target was the masses. The Russian peasant, the Russian worker and the Russian soldier in 1917 were all for pie-in-the-sky and peace on earth but they generally disapproved of civil massacre and organized defeatism as means of attaining them. Lenin’s ruthless bid for power, his program of revolutionary dictatorship and his call for immediate peace at any price seemed shocking to idealistic Russian leftists, including some of his own party. In June when he announced before an all-Russian congress of soviets that the Bolsheviks were ready to take over the government at any moment, and that their first act would be to hang fifty or a hundred capitalists, Kerensky indignantly interrupted him. “You Bolsheviks,” he shouted from the floor, “what are you? Socialists or police of the old regime?” Not only the congress, but most of Russia applauded the rebuke.


funny


	...“Would you have mastered the Bolsheviks if you had made a separate peace?” Lord Beaverbrook, the British publisher, asked Kerensky when they were introduced in a London club by Sir Bruce Lockhart, who relates the anecdote in his memoirs, British Agent, “Of course,” Kerensky replied (according to Lockhart). ‘We should be in Moscow now.”


somehow, Kerensky figures it out too late


	Some skepticism is permissible, given the caliber of the opposition that Kerensky faced and the inherent weaknesses of the dual-power system in Russia that he had helped to set up.


Referring to the Soviet/Provisional Government thing? not sure how Kerensky helped set that up should look into that


	...One was the land-hunger of the peasants which left-wing demagogy exploited by agitating for immediate distribution of private estates. The other was the national aspirations of the Empire’s subject peoples: Poles, Finns, Ukrainians, Baltic nations, and the smaller ethnic minorities. All these submerged nations began to stir after the March Revolution; a bold federalist program might have held their separatist tendencies within bounds and at the same time have won over their middle classes as allies of Russian democracy against the Bolshevik threat. Instead, as the German historian Georg von Rauch puts it, “The Provisional Government remained as before a slave of the narrow, nationalist and centralist thinking of the overthrown Czarist regime,” and the minorities became more and more alienated.


Kerensky government said to have had poor domestic policy


	...There is no doubt, however, that the Provisional Government in trying to keep Russia in the war killed whatever slender chances of survival it may have had. George Kennan argues rather convincingly that only a general compromise peace might possibly have saved the democratic regime in Russia. President Wilson, who in his speech of April 2, 1917, calling for a declaration of war against the Central Powers had hailed “the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening the last few weeks in Russia,” made no move in the direction of peace—quite the contrary—and neither did the other Allied leaders. Instead they put heavy pressure on the new Russian government to fight on to victory. When Milyukov at the beginning of May pledged Russia to do exactly that—the pledge was in the form of a diplomatic note to Russia’s allies—he provoked the first political crisis of the new regime. The Finnish Regiment threatened to mutiny and there were riots in the capital. To ease the strain, Milyukov and Guchkov resigned, Prince Lvov brought several moderate socialists into the government and Kerensky took over the War Ministry.

	The warning did not suffice. The Allies not only stepped up their pressure on the Provisional Government to stay in the war—“No fight, no loans,” as former Secretary of State Elihu Root succinctly put it when he arrived at the head of an American aid mission in June—but began insisting that the battered, disorganized Russian armies once more take the offensive. Kerensky, despite his earlier misgivings (and his later hindsight) responded enthusiastically to this suicidal demand. Wearing a peasant blouse and a military cap he toured the trenches, haranguing the troops. He replaced Alexeyev as commander-in-chief with General A. A. Brusilov, the most brilliant, and reputedly the most socialist of the Russian generals; he somehow persuaded the military soviets to co-operate with the officer corps in restoring discipline. On the home front he instigated a vigorous campaign against defeatism. Even the Ex Com of the Petrograd Soviet joined in with an appeal to the soldiers which informed them that they were no longer “fighting for the Czar, for Protopopov, Rasputin and the rich, but for Russian freedom and the Revolution.”


To put this in perspective: meanwhile in Germany, anti-war riots in the peace, Reichstag passess resolution for general peace, high command ignores them and carries on the war, obsessed with a separate peace with Russia, which they are convinced Lenin will give them.


	...The leftist fiasco in the July days, as the abortive uprising is usually termed, temporarily saved the Provisional Government from the consequences of the debacle at the front, and brought Kerensky to the Premiership—he succeeded Prince Lvov on July 20. The Bolshevik role in the disorders had destroyed any remaining illusions Kerensky may have had about Lenin, Trotsky, and their companions as being “normal” Socialist leaders, just a little more extreme in their views perhaps, than others. The Bolsheviks, Kerensky now realized, were ruthless and incorrigible conspirators. Evidence collected by the Russian military counterespionage service purporting to establish that Lenin was a paid German agent played a big part in this phase of Kerensky’s political education. With his acute sense of propaganda he made the dubious information the basis for a violent campaign against the Bolsheviks, accusing them—among other crimes—of having deliberately fomented the July rising on orders from their German employers to support the counteroffensive on the Galician front. The evidence available to Kerensky in 1917, while sometimes dose to the truth, was not true evidence; it led him to underestimate his adversaries—if the Bolshevik leaders had been German agents, mere venal adventurers, they would have proved much less dangerous than they turned out to be—and it may help to explain why the governmental smear campaign against the party, after initially arousing a great deal of patriotic indignation, eventually ceased to interest the Russian public.{


The "Lenin is a German agent" idea serving as a pretext to crack down on the Bolsheviks.


	...The demonstration seemed all the more useful, from Kerensky’s viewpoint, because at the moment he was drawing closer to the right. He had agreed to restore the death penalty in the army and had appointed General Kornilov, a stem disciplinarian, commander-in-chief.



appointed Kornilov, restored death penalty (exploited in Bolshevik propaganda)


	...Kerensky, of course, was not solely to blame for what happened. Kornilov’s lack of political maturity, his impatience, and probably his ambition were contributory factors. So were the divergent intrigues or pressures of Russia’s allies: the British and French military attachés were egging on Kornilov, while the U.S. Embassy encouraged Kerensky to resist his demands. At first the two men agreed, or thought they had agreed, on the need for a firm hand both in the army and on the home front. Then Kornilov began to feel that Kerensky was weaseling out of his agreements, while Kerensky came to look on Kornilov as a potential rival and as a threat to Russian democracy. The noisy support that the right gave to what soon became known as “Kornilovism” naturally added to these fears. Kornilov, who was the son of a Siberian Cossack, was not a monarchist, but he believed that some form of rule more authoritarian than the existing Provisional Government was needed to rescue the nation from chaos, and he was quite frankly preparing a military coup against the Petrograd Soviet and its left-wing supporters. Kerensky gave the pugnacious commander-in-chief the impression that he acquiesced in the scheme, but he may have been misled about its full scope. The whole affair was a fearful and complex imbroglio in which reciprocal lack of confidence led each man to act more and more behind the other’s back, thereby generating graver suspicion. Finally, on September 9, with Kornilov’s Cossacks moving on Petrograd, Kerensky trapped him into some incriminating admissions and dismissed him from his post.


Then later Burtsev says there was a "compact" between them--what exactly did he mean by that?


	Kornilov retaliated with a pronunciamento against the Provisional Government and ordered his cavalry under General Krymov to occupy the capital. Kerensky appealed to the Petrograd Soviet for help and called the workers to arms. Trotsky, from his prison cell, urged the Bolsheviks to rally round the government, and a kind of informal popular front sprang up. Lenin’s followers eagerly accepted the weapons which were thrust in their hands. Apparently the Kornilovists had not expected mass resistance and the risk of civil war unnerved them. General Krymov allowed himself to be captured without a fight, then blew his brains out. Kornilov and his staff tamely submitted to arrest.

	That was the end of the putsch. It was, of course, also the end of Kerensky’s anti-Bolshevik front, which since the July days, had held together the more responsible elements of the left and the more intelligent elements of the right. Trotsky and most of the other imprisoned Bolshevik leaders were released. Kerensky proclaimed the republic, nominated himself president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces and set up a new government which included several leftists—among them the new War Minister, General Verkhovsky, the acting military attaché in Belgrade at the time of Sarajevo. For political support it relied upon the most incorrigibly fuzzy-minded elements of the non-Communist left; Mensheviks, Social-Revolutionaries, and allied splinter groups.


Then this is the reason for freeing and arming the Bolsheviks

	
	...Kerensky believed that in crushing the Kornilov putsch, which he had earlier encouraged, he had somehow won a major victory over the left as well as over the right.


then Kerensky acts suspicious in trying to make his alliance with the left, apparently Russians become suspicious of him


	...Soviet. Preparations for the coup had been camouflaged as defensive measures against a renewed assault of the “Kornilovists,” and a justificatory pretext for launching it was furnished by provoking the government into striking the first blow. During the night of November 6-7, the Bolshevik shock troops, mainly the Red Guard worker-militiamen whom Kerensky had thoughtlessly armed during the Kornilov scare stealthily infiltrated a number of key positions in the city. The sailors from the cruiser Aurora—which Kerensky had ordered to the capital in September—along with some mutinous machine-gun units and other troops joined the Bolsheviks. The bulk of the still-dependable army units with which the government might have crushed the revolt as in July had been removed from the vicinity of the capital out of fear of another rightist putsch. The loyal forces immediately available in Petrograd were inadequate, and within twenty-four hours the government, under bombardment in the Winter Palace, from the Aurora, was forced to capitulate.


Kerensky orders in red battleship, orders out white soldiers from capital (this is after he nominated himself president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces after Kornilov affair)


	It was probably the Bolsheviks' good luck that while most of the ministers were arrested Kerensky managed to escape and reach army headquarters at Pskov. His fiery appeals to drive the usurpers out of the capital led to a piecemeal and improvised counter-offensive that was doomed before it started. Many of the Russian generals who still retained some authority over their troops refused all sup- port to the man they considered mainly responsible for the country's mis- fortunes, while others were paralyzed by the fear of antagonizing the soldiers' Soviets. Finally Kerensky persuaded a Cossack commander, General P. N. Krasnov, to move on Petrograd with a sketchily equipped detachment of some 700 men. Whatever chance Krasnov had of regaining control in the capital with this force was lost through delay mainly the result of a strike called by the railway workers in the queer belief that they were making a useful protest against the Bolshevik coup d'etat. After a brief skirmish with a body of Red militia at Tsarskoe Selo, Krasnov's Cossacks began to show signs of disaffection, and Kerensky, who was accompanying them, gave up the fight, escaping in disguise. (He later slipped across the Finnish border with the help of the British agent Bruce Lockhart, and vanished into the wings of history.) A Bolshevik rising in Moscow to support the Petrograd one barely succeeded in the face of uncoordinated resistance.


Kerensky tries to unite generals against Bolsheviks but they all hate him or think troops won't support it. "Anti-Bolshevik" protest stops small force from retaking capital. Cossaks disband and Kerensky escapes in disguise--with the help of Bruce Lockhart?

	...Kerensky joined the Russian Labour Party and in 1912 was elected to the State Duma. A socialist, Kerensky developed a strong following amongst industrial workers. He also played an important role in the exposure of Roman Malinovsky, one of the leaders of the Bolsheviks, as an undercover agent of the Okhrana.


interesting--help out Malinovksy?

	In 1896 the Northern Union of Socialist Revolutionaries was formed. This was followed by other such groups in other parts of Russia. In 1901, some of the leading figures in these groups, including Catherine Breshkovskaya, Victor Chernov, Gregory Gershuni, Nikolai Avksentiev, Alexander Kerensky and Evno Azef, founded the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries (SR).


http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSgershuni.htm
	At his trial Gershuni was sentenced to death, a sentence subsequently commuted to life imprisonment and hard labour. In 1905 he escaped from Akatui Prison in Eastern Siberia. After travelling via China and the USA, Gershuni arrived back in Europe in February, 1907.

	In exile Gershuni continued to argue for a campaign of terror in order to overthrow the Tsar in Russia. He strongly defended Evno Azef against claims being made that he was a traitor.

	...Burtzev's triumph had been due partly to Agafonov and a split among Socialist Revolutionaries. The party's Central Committee had been formed in Paris under the leadership of a few exiled revolutionaries of considerable wealth such as Viktor Chernov and Mark Natanson.   In frequent conflict with these leaders were a number of professional people, lawyers and journalists in exile, most of them struggling for their livelihood. These, like Burtzev, considered the leaders too lax and complacent about the possibility of Okhrana penetrations.

	...After Natanson and Chernov, for example, had in 1913 approved a project to dispatch Ziama Kisin with a team to Petersburg to murder Minister of Education Kaso, Burtzev warned them that the conspiracy might have been penetrated by the Okhrana. When they wanted to go ahead with the operation despite his warnings, he threatened to expose them as provocateurs if anything should go wrong.   They had to drop the plan.

relationship between Kerensky and Malinovksy worth looking at?



Brackman book says Kerensky did read one of his declarations to the Duma:

	His colleagues refused to support his idea. On 7 May 1914
Malinovsky provoked a scandal by making a blistering attack on the government,
demanding the declaration of absolute freedom of speech. Kerensky read this proposed
declaration in his speech to the Duma. Rodzianko warned him nine times to ‘stop
insulting the Duma’ and then deprived him of the right to speak. When Malinovsky
delivered his speech, Rodzianko, after two warnings, ordered him to stop, but
Malinovsky refused. The Duma police removed him from the hall by force. The next day,
Malinovsky walked into Rodzianko’s office and threw his resignation on the desk,
saying, ‘Excuse me, I am leaving the Duma. I have no time. Excuse me.’

from the Abraham biography:


	The authorities had their hands full and it is hardly surprising that they failed to charge Kerensky within the legal time limit. He became sufficiently indignant at this to go on hunger strike. After a few days, the authorities gave way, to the extent of charging him with the preparation of the violent overthrow of the government, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of perpetual hard labor, the counterproductive nature of this “victory” did not disturb him: “My hunger strike had been motivated by the desire to draw to the attention of the public the fact that the law continued to be violated despite the October Manifesto.”

	His friends let him down, suppressing news of his action to avoid worrying Olga—a misjudgement as she would certainly have publicized his gesture immediately.
	The capital's press was full of the indignities suffered by libertarian young people of good family. In fact they got almost as much attention as the massacres of rebellious workers and peasants.


was this a made-up story? maybe instead of a "hunger strike" he agreed to work for them.


	Kerensky was released “under the special surveillance of the police” on April 5, 1906, the day after Oleg's first birthday. He was to be banished from the capitals for several years while Vasiliev and the others were allowed to resume their normal occupations. Kerensky was livid: “I, who had done nothing but store some of their pamphlets in my apartment, was to have my whole life distorted.” It is just possible that this discrimination was due to his approach to the fighting organization. After a period of noncollaboration with the police department in the latter part of 1905, Azef resumed his former role in 1906. In due course, he would betray Klitchoglu and many others. One official is alleged to have mocked Kerensky with the taunt: ‘‘This one dreams of killing the Tsar.” Even more intriguing is the allegation of Okhrana General Gerasimov that Kerensky was the “head of the fighting group of the Socialist Revolutionaries of the Alexander-Nevsky District.”


police release him for some reason under "special surveillance of the police"

Okhrana General Gerasimov alleges Kerensky was the “head of the fighting group of the Socialist Revolutionaries of the Alexander-Nevsky District.”


source of that is: AK, Turning Point, 71–72; Kerenskii po DP, 6; Nicolaevsky, Aseff,
133; Savinkov, Memoirs, 323; Gerasimoff, Kampf, 77; AK interviewed by
E. Ivanoff, Tape No. 6, n.d., 6, Kerensky Papers, F.97.


Gerasimov was also Azef's handler


	Strings were pulled to enable Kerensky to meet the nominal director of the police department, with whose daughters he had once danced. Kerensky pointed out that exile would wreck his career and insisted that imprisonment would be preferable. Eventually it was agreed that he spend a long holiday with his father in Tashkent, less a compromise than a capitulation by the professional policemen, who retained their suspicions of him, to the pressure exercised by Kerensky's father's connections in society. In September 1906, after their return to St. Petersburg, the case was finally laid to rest.


has some sort of meeting with head of police


	On hearing of his son's arrest, Fyodor Kerensky had written a vitriolic letter to Olga, accusing her of ruining his son and predicting that should would ruin his grandson. The distraught Olga showed the letter to Elena, who told her to destroy it and never to mention it to Kerensky. Olga burnt it, but she could not quite follow her sister-in-law's advice to forget it, and she always retained bitter memories of the summer in Tashkent that followed. The old man's normally impeccable manners had deserted him and he barely managed to say “good morning” and “good night.” Even the presence of his grandchild failed to mollify him.


his father blames his wife Olga for ruining him


what was his relation with Azef? Okhrana apparently tried to control the Social Revolutionaries


from Abraham book:

	Unaware that he was already under surveillance, Kerensky tried to get into even deeper water in December 1905. This is one of several mysterious incidents in his life of which he never told Olga, and for which we have only his word. Outraged by Nicholas II's public patronage of the anti-Semitic “Union of the Russian People,” Kerensky decided to assassinate him. He therefore asked Zhenya Moiseenko to arrange a rendezvous for him with her brother Boris. Zhenya was at first reluctant to help; she was fond of Olga and baby Oleg was only eight months old. Still, her revolutionary duty was clear, and she arranged what proved to be the first of two meetings between Moiseenko and Kerensky. At the first, Kerensky explained his motives for wanting to join the Fighting Organization. At the second, Moiseenko informed him that his offer had been rejected in view of his inexperience. Kerensky was chagrined to find himself regarded in the same condescending light in which he saw the “revolutionary romantics” around him.

	Many years later, Moiseenko is alleged to have told Kerensky that he had been rejected at the behest of the Head of the Fighting Organization, Yevno Azef. This version was much more flattering to Kerensky's amour propre, since Azef had by then been shown up as a double agent. It may also be true. The Fighting Organization was overwhelmed by volunteers at this time (only the Okhrana itself received more offers of collaboration from the perennially destitute Russian intelligentsia). Azef always tried to put off recruits on principle (as a police agent) and for reasons of efficiency and security (as a terrorist).


so apparently tried to join Azefs terrorist squad

also says he plotted to assassinate the Tsar in December 1905, and his fellow "revolutionary" Evgenia (Zhenya) Moiseenko told Azef, an Okhrana agent. If true, would mean the Okhrana knew he plotted to assassinate the tsar since 1905, and depending on what he did might have had something to use on him. Was arrested (or at least released) in 1906.

	So it all happened. The passer-by, who was Boris Moiseyenko, bent to light a cigarette, and at that moment Kerensky expressed his request in a whisper - he wanted to take part in the preparation of another terrorist act. Moiseenko promised to give an answer in a few days, but when the time came, he passed through his sister that nothing would turn out. Twelve years later, when Kerensky takes the ministerial seat, Boris Moiseyenko will return from emigration to Russia. Kerensky will remind him of this meeting, and Moiseenko will tell you that he refused at the insistence of the then leader of the militant organization of the Social Revolutionaries, Ye. F. Azef.

	Kerensky was plotting the killing of the tsar. The same plans were borne by the members of the Combat Organization of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Sometimes their approach was unnecessarily creative. Boris Savinkov recalled that they bought an airplane and set up a motor for a long flight to go up, throw bombs at the palace in Peterhof, where the Emperor Nikolai was with his family and close friends, and fly abroad ... In the country still military aviation is not really it was only being formed, and the targeting of the bombing was not yet used, and the terrorists had already tried to use the airplane to kill. Only technical problems and prevented. 

	...As it later turned out, the question of Kerensky's participation in the Combat Organization was decided personally by Azef, who, as a police agent, informed the Security Department of all the news of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The newcomer refused to Azef, and the police authorities undoubtedly informed him of the enthusiastic terror that had appeared.

	And Kerensky, even learning about the role of Azef, did not understand why he was preventively arrested for several months, having found an excuse.
	The arrest came as a surprise:

	[quote from Kerensky's book]



Abraham book:

	...In January 1913, the head of the Paris Agency of the Okhrana wrote to the Director of the Police Department, claiming that Kerensky was a member of the Central Committee of the PSR. The letter alleged that Kerensky had joined the party in 1903, that he had belonged to the Petersburg Committee in 1906, and—most startling of all—that he had some connection with Bogroy, who assassinated Stolypin following the Premier's loss of Imperial favor in 1911. It concluded:

		in the autumn of 1911, when a split occurred in the PSR, three different currents were formed and Pochin began to appear, Kerensky announced his departure from the Central Committee, but was obliged to remain until the calling of a council or congress of the party.48

	This fantastic picture of Kerensky's conspiratorial achievements is as much an exaggeration as Chernov's contrary suggestion that Kerensky only “called himself a Socialist Revolutionary”. It was a retrospective attempt to explain the importance that Kerensky quite suddenly assumed in 1912 by men who had failed to forsee such a development. Stolypin's assassination had been facilitated by police negligence, and the Okhrana had good reasons for wanting to place the blame on the opposition. At all events, they were bolting the stable door after the horse had fled.


head of Paris Okhrana claimed Kerensky had relations with assassin of Stolypin


	...The next day, Rodzyanko was astonished when Malinovsky visited him to announce his resignation, and thunderstruck when Assistant Minister of the Interior Dzhunkovsky arrived to tell him that Malinovsky had been a police agent all along. Dzhunkovsky had no obvious personal axe to grind and the reasons for Malinovsky's exposure have never been established. However, it may be that the Okhrana though this the easiest way of terminating an experiment that had gotten out of hand. Malinovsky was supposed to split the Social Democrats, not win them a mass following. Lenin refused to accept that his Duma favorite had been a police agent and, though this discredited him in some quarters, it may have been a lesser evil than the demoralization that afflicted the SRs after Azef's exposure. The major beneficiary of the episode was Alexander Kerensky. As a percipient English journalist recorded:

		The mysterious disappearance of the Okhrana spy, Malinovski, who had been the leader of the Bolsheviks in the Duma, removed the only man who could rival Kerensky in appeal to the masses.

Kerensky's war minister, Verkhovsky, was also involved in the assassination of Ferdinand:

http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1989/eirv16n13-19890324/eirv16n13-19890324.pdf

this is full article

Verkhovsky was an assistant to Artamanov at the time of the assassination, although apparently he did not give any additional insight into the assassination. One pg 38 is a denial of involvement by Artamanov.


reportedly Verkhovsky told Louis de Trydar-Bruzynski "the truth about the origins, preparations, and execution of the plot:"


	Another source cited by Albertini,  the Russian-Polish archeologist and member of the former Archeological Insti­tute of St.  Petersburg, Louis de Trydar-Bruzynski, stated in his 1926 memoirs:  "The assassination was perpetrated with the  support of  the Russian Military Attache at  Belgrade. Captain Werchovski [Verkhovsky], who was assistant to the Military Attache [Artamonov] and was later War Minister in the Kerensky Government, a young man whom I had known very well for years and all his family,  told me quite frankly the truth about the origins, preparations and execution of the plot."

	On April 13, 1932, when this passage was reprinted in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, it was footnoted with the comment, "Alexander Ivanovich Werchovski [Verkhovsky] is still alive and holds a high command in the Red Army.  His evidence, therefore, can still be obtained." 


Anything else by Verkhovsky? If he had information on this it would be a big deal, but so far can't find much except for people saying he would have known more (and would be tight-lipped since he held a high position in the Soviet military.)

Would it have been "out of character" for Kerensky to choose Verkhovsky as War Minister? ostensibly, they wouldn't want anyone with ties to "Tsarist plots"


from Taylor:

	There may be one man still alive who knows the whole story; the Russian assistant military attaché, Captain Alexander Werchovski, who replaced Artamanov during his absence. A friend of Werchovski, a Polish nobleman named Louis de Trydar-Burzynski, stated in his memoirs, published in Italy in 1926, that “the assassination [at Sarajevo] was perpetrated with the support of the Russian military attaché at Belgrade, Captain Werchovski...” Werchovski, he continued, “was later War Minister in the Kerensky government; he was a young man whom I had known very well for years, and he told me quite frankly the truth about the origins, preparations and execution of the plot.” Unfortunately, Werchovski, if he is living today, is not likely to tell any more about the case; when last heard of, he held a high command in the Red Army—a curious detail in itself.


does sound like Verchovsky was tight-lipped
