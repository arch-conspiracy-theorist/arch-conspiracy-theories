	China officially admitted to the drug problem stemming from North Korea in 2004, with Jilin Province being the most important transshipment point from North Korea.[10] The production, storage, financing, and sale of the North Korea's methamphetamine trade reaches multiple countries from the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others.[5] In 2010, five foreign nationals were prosecuted as part of a conspiracy involving North Korea to smuggle 40 pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and to sell it for $30,000 a pound.[7]

	In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion.[1] In a 2013 Washington Post article, annual revenues from methamphetamine sales are estimated at $100 million to $200 million.[11]

	Between 1977 and 2003, more than twenty North Korean diplomats, agents, and trade officials have been implicated, detained, or arrested in drug-smuggling operations in more than a dozen countries.[1] In 2004, two North Korean embassy employees were caught smuggling 150,000 tablets of Clonazepam in Egypt, and in that same year, embassy employees from Bulgaria were arrested in Turkey in possession of over 500,000 tablets of Captagon (the brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, or phenethylline), with an estimated street value of $7 million.[4]:p37 The government of North Korea has only admitted that such acts were undertaken by individuals, and not at the direction of the state.[4]:p17

	According to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, since 2001 drug trafficking operations by diplomats had ceased, with the focus then becoming the production of drugs to be smuggled by other criminal organizations.[4]:p18

NK selling drugs throughout the world



------


world was going our way:

Among the many paradoxes in Nkrumah’s volatile
personality was the fact that, despite his anti-American
rhetoric, he was deeply distressed by President Kennedy’s
assassination and had a warm personal friendship with
Kennedy’s ambassador, William P. Mahoney, and his
family. 21 Encouraged by KGB active measures, however,
his suspicions of the CIA deepened and darkened. Like
Ben Bella, Nkrumah was taken in by Service A
forgeries. 22 After an assassination attempt against him in
1962 Nkrumah became obsessed by the belief that the
Agency was plotting his overthrow, frequently giving
visitors copies of a book denouncing CIA conspiracies. 23
In February 1964 he became so incensed by a bogus letter
fabricated by Service A, supposedly written by a
disillusioned US military intelligence officer, which
purported to reveal the hostile operations of both the CIA
and SIS against his regime, that he wrote a personal letter
of protest to President Lyndon Johnson, accusing the CIA
of devoting all its energies to ‘clandestine and subversive
activities among our people’. To emphasize the
importance of his protest, Nkrumah instructed the
Ghanaian ambassador in Washington to deliver it in
person. 


reminds me of Kim Jong Un



The most important lesson drawn by Nkrumah from his
overthrow was ‘that independent African states must
pursue a policy of all-out socialism if they are to
survive’. 35 That his host in Guinea, Sékou Touré,
survived in power, however, was due not to ‘all-out
socialism’ but to the pervasiveness of his reign of terror
which left even the army too cowed to attempt a military
coup. The prisoners brought from their homes in the early
hours for interrogation at Camp Boiro and other prison
camps constructed with assistance from the East German
Stasi and the Czechoslovak StB were tortured until they
confessed to the usually imaginary conspiracies with
which Sékou Touré was obsessed. 36 The KGB turned a
blind eye to the horrors of the Guinean regime, preferring
instead to exploit its leader’s paranoid tendencies by
active measures designed to convince him that the CIA
was plotting to overthrow him. On at least one occasion
(and probably on others not noted by Mitrokhin), the
Centre heightened the dramatic impact of Service A’s
forgeries by sending a senior KGB officer to Conakry, the
Guinean capital, to deliver them in person. When shown
the forgeries, Sékou Touré became - according to a KGB
report - highly emotional, exclaiming angrily, ‘The filthy
imperialists!’ The CIA officers responsible for the (non-
existent) plot would, he declared, be expelled within
twenty-four hours: ‘We highly appreciate the concern
shown by our Soviet comrades.
