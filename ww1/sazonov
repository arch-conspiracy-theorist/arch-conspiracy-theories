Sazanov played a big part in starting the war by convincing the Tsar to mobilize (and telling the Russian official carrying out the order to smash his phone).  But what was his motive? He might have acted suspicious after the war too in his role in the White movement.

Need to understand this more, but it sounds like Sazanov did a bad job of securing Finish aid for the White's assault on Petrograd. He was in charge of a conference related to this in Paris, but it didn't fall through. He was also in charge of delivering some messages to the Finish but communications weren't so great (delayed telegrams). Was said to be "obstinate" about Finnish independence even while the Whites needed their help.

	Neratov entirely approved this telegram, and Buchanan and I immediately returned to our embassies to send it to Mohilev.

	This afternoon I received from a reliable source certain details of the intrigue against Sazonov. My informant (a woman) does not know how far things have got and I have been careful not to tell her.

	"Sazonov's position is very much compromised," she said; "he has lost the confidence of Their Majesties."

	"What's the accusation against him?"

	"He's accused of not getting on with Sturmer and, on the other hand, getting on too well with the Duma... . And then Rasputin hates him - which is enough by itself."

	"So the Empress has absolutely made common cause with Sturmer?"

	"Yes, absolutely. Sturmer is full of low cunning and he has succeeded in persuading her that she alone can save Russia. She's saving her at this very moment; she went off to Mohilev quite unexpectedly last night

	As an ironic footnote, on October 29 Sazonov in Paris, despite the protests of the faltering "Supreme Ruler" in Omsk, agreed to recognize the "factual" independence of Finland and even offered to pay Finnish expenses in a joint campaign against Petrograd. Alas, it was far too late!

	The whole episode had a fantasy-like yet tragic quality. It was quite clear, not only in retrospect but at the time, that the capture of Petrograd would deal a serious, perhaps mortal blow to the Bolshevik cause; it was equally clear that the city could be taken only with the help of the Finns and that they would assist only if their independence and territorial aspirations were recognized by the White Russian leaders. Only a few miles from Petrograd stood a willing, even eager General Mannerheim, the Finnish commander. Thousands of miles away in the heart of Siberia stood a proud a patriotic Russian admiral, the nominal ruler of Russia, whose armies were already in full retreat before the Bolsheviks. Blinded by national pride and oblivious to the realities of the situation, Kolchak refused to yield what the Finns asked, even when his own dreams were in ruins. Here, as in its relations with the peoples of the Baltic and the Caucasus, the White RUssian leadership proved fatally shortsighted, contributing heavily to its downfall.

	Up to now the government has followed and will continue to follow the same relations with the Russians. Finland canot bind itself to give strategic gurantees to Sazonov. Kammerer's threats in this condition are rejected by various Entente diplomats here. Sazonov's offer to pay for the Petrograd expedition and to arrange for all other questions concerning Finland's demands are on the whole not adequate.
