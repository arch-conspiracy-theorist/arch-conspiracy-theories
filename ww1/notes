a series of concidencies and inexplicalbe decisions made the war and the Bolshevik revolution possible:


the july crisis:


- Artamanov and Verchovsky knew who was behind the assassination, but didn't tell anyone, even after the crisis


- Hartwig probably knew, but was assassinated before he could tell anyone (it sounded like he was going to tell Austria-Hungary)


- The French minister in Belgrade and the French Government knew, but didn't tell Austria-Hungary


- Austria-Hungary was trying to start a war with Serbia anyway, designed demands to be rejected


- German Foreign ministry encouraged Austria-Hungary with "blank cheque"


- After meeting Poincare, Sazanov sent a warning to Bertchtold of dangerous consequences of "such a step may lead if it is of a character unacceptable to the dignity of serbia," but Berchtold told Russian Charge d'Affaires he was "busy" and couldn't see him until next morning, then sent the ultimatum to Serbia that night. The ultimatum was intentionally timed so that it was received just before Poincare left Russian waters (why is that intentional timing important?)


- Poincare had a policy of supporting Russia in war regarding "Balkan affairs," an agreement facilitated by Izvolsky. France recalled ambassador George Louis who was opposed to this policy. Rachkovsky also helped make this possible (how? paying off press? gaining clout with French politicians? Butterworth says Rachkovsky takes some of the blame). French foreign policy people were selected by Poincare in a way exceeding his constitutional authority, and they were (in the words of Viviani) "entirely ready to support the action of the [Russian] imperial government."



- Georges Louis and Jaures asked Poincare not to go on trip to St. Petersburg (presumably this would antagonize Germany and increase the odds of conflict, especially after Sarjevo), but he went anyway

some people act suspicious:


- Sazanov blamed the war on "powerful and dangerous forces" and "madmen" in Austria in a telegram to Germany, even though he later acted to start the war.


- Nobody recorded the meeting between Poincare and Russian officials when they should have. Georges Louis asked Poincare what was said but he would never tell.


- lots of sides blocking mediation:

	...The "slide" thesis is also rendered spurious by the various actions, espe- cially in the three critical capitals - Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg - to block possible mediation of the crisis. Foreign Minister Berchtold as early as 3 July boldly informed the German ambassador, Heinrich von Tschirschky, of his government's need for a "final and fundamental reckoning" with Serbia. Kaiser Wilhelm II at Berlin endorsed that ini- tiative with the terse marginalia, "now or never." Vienna refused a state funeral for Archduke Franz Ferdinand in part because such a formal gath- ering might have offered the crowned heads of Europe an opportunity to discuss and perhaps to coordinate their responses to the assassination at Sarajevo. Vienna was determined to strike out against Belgrade; Berlin seconded that initiative. And once Russia had decided to block the pro- posed Habsburg "punitive expedition" against Serbia by way of mobiliza- tion, Foreign Minister Sazonov forestalled further discussion and possible resolution of the crisis by instructing General Ianushkevich, the chief of the General Staff, to smash his telephone!
