A certain Mr. Simmons testifies that Hollweg dispatched a socialist as agent to Switzerland to study the socialists there and find the most radical ones. In Simmon's account, the socialist agent reported back that Lenin was the most radical, but not to support him as it would bring chaos and ruin to Russia.


Also in the hearing was an excerpt from "The German-Bolshevik Conspiracy"


Simmons appears to be "Roger E. Simmons"

	After the Battle of the Marne, Bethmann-Hollweg urged a cessation of hostilities as soon as possible. He lost faith that Germany could win a total victory, and recognized that Germany was outmatched in terms of raw manpower and economic stability. The Allies were content to prolong the war, but Germany needed to end it quickly. To this end, Bethmann-Hollweg proposed that Germany should isolate one member of the Entente Powers and conclude a separate peace with them. Bethmann-Hollweg surmised that if Germany could break up the Entente, they could coerce the other two countries to the negotiating table, on Germany’s terms.


Hollweg says "we are screwed we need peace!" but decides that the way is to get a "spearate peace" with one country and then bring the rest of the allies to the negotiating table. Seems to be a set-up for the foreign ministry's subsequent involvement with the Bolsheviks.

	However, Bethmann - Hollweg soon shifted his initial opinion that Germany needed to win the war q uickly. He held that Germany must defend the Western Front and outlast the Allies.  While the West held firm, the Germans could advance slowly eastward and convince the Russians to sue for peace. Bethmann - Hollweg used the Danish King Hans Neil Andersen as a mediato r to determine whether Russia was interested in peace


and of course he chooses Russia. How does any of this make sense? the whole war started betweeen Germany and Russia in the first place!


	....As a result of this dilemma, the flow of information between the two branches decreased.  Falkenhayn did not tell Bethmann-Hollweg about his operational agenda and Bethmann-Hollweg neglected to involve Falkenhayn in diplomatic affairs.38Falkenhayn and Bethmann-Hollweg never worked together, so how could Germany expect to win the war when the two most crucial branches failed to communicate with one another?  While Bethmann-Hollweg was busy chasing peace, the generals pursued efforts to win a total military victory.  


there are documents of Hollweg consulting Falkenhayn, but if this is true it could have been part of setting-up the Foreign Ministry for their operations

The Foreign Ministry seems worse (more traitorous) than the German Military command. One hint is that there were apparently "intrigues" to oust Falkenhayn and he was unpopular with the General Staff. Another hint is that Hollweg blamed the military leaders for everything. It's hard to say for sure.

Then again, it is true that Ludendorff was involved with the operations to fund the Bolsheviks, and he signed off on some of it.

Bethman-Hollweg also approved of Lenin's trip, and did some shady shit that helped start the war


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fischer
	Fischer was the first German historian to publish documents showing that the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg had made plans in September 1914 (after the war began) to annex all of Belgium, part of France and part of Russia.[1]

Lenin upset that someone said he was working with Hollweg

says there were rumors that Hollweg met with Lenin--did he? where did rumors come from?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Riezler
	During this period, Riezler served as the conduit for German subsidies to the Bolsheviks and personally negotiated these with Lenin's representatives Karl Radek and Alexander Parvus. Riezler later claimed privately that it had been his own idea to transport Lenin in the famous "sealed train" from Zurich through Germany to Russia in April 1917.

was transporting Lenin this guy's idea?


passage on Lenin train rumor says "possible" Lenin met with Riezler

not sure about author of that one though


http://www.thehistoryforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30125
	German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg reported to the Kaiser that “immediately” upon learning of the events in Russia (March 14), he instructed Gisbert von Romberg, the German Minister in Berne, to offer the Bolshevik exiles passage through Germany. Indeed, there was no time to lose! Already Germany had initiated the submarine warfare policy which would soon bring a U.S. declaration of war. Everything now depended upon a peace treaty with Russia that would enable Germany to transfer a million troops to the Western front and thereby bring the War to a victorious conclusion before American military might could be brought to bear.

In 1914, Hollweg says Germany would not accept peace unless Belgium restored and Germany gets indemnity


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobald_von_Bethmann-Hollweg
	His main concern was Russian border manoeuvres, conveyed by his ambassadors at a time when Raymond Poincaré himself was preparing a secret mission to St Petersburg. He wrote to Count Sergey Sazonov:

    	Russian mobilisation measures would compel us to mobilise and that then European war could scarcely be prevented.

Hollweg told Sazonov mobilization would lead to war, then Sazanov does it anyway...

was it a warning? or more like advice...

	Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, Bethmann-Hollweg and his foreign minister, Gottlieb von Jagow, were instrumental in assuring Austria-Hungary of Germany's unconditional support, regardless of Austria's actions against Serbia. While Grey was suggesting a mediation between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, Bethmann-Hollweg wanted Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and so he tampered with the British message and deleted the last line of the letter:

    	"Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy."


so clearly wanted a war. Did he want a local war or a global one?


https://blog.oup.com/2014/07/29-july-1914-russian-mobilization-first-world-war/
	At 4 p.m. the German general staff received intelligence that Belgium was calling up reservists, raising the numbers of the Belgian army from 50,000 to 100,000, equipping its fortifications and reinforcing defences along the frontier. Forty minutes later a meeting at the Neue Palais in Potsdam, the Kaiser and his advisers decided to compose an ultimatum to present to Belgium: either agree to adopt an attitude of ‘benevolent neutrality’ towards Germany in a European war or face dire consequences.

	Simultaneously, Bethmann Hollweg decided to launch a bold new initiative. He proposed to the British ambassador that Britain agree to remain neutral in the event of war in exchange for a German promise not to seize any French territory in Europe when it ended. He understood that Britain would not allow France to be crushed, but this was not Germany’s aim. When asked whether his proposal applied to French colonies as well, the chancellor replied that he was unable to give a similar undertaking concerning them. Belgium’s integrity would be respected when the war ended –as long as it had not sided against Germany.


Hollweg already divvying-up territory before war even started

	...Yet another German initiative was taken in St Petersburg. At 7 p.m. the German ambassador transmitted a warning from the chancellor that if Russia continued with its military preparations Germany would be compelled to mobilize, in which case it would take the offensive. Sazonov replied that this removed any doubts he may have had concerning the real cause of Austria’s intransigence.

	The Russians found this confusing, as they had just received another telegram from the Kaiser containing a plea that he should not permit Russian military measures to jeopardize German efforts to promote a direct understanding between Russia and Austria. It was agreed that the Tsar should wire Berlin immediately to ask for an explanation of the apparent discrepancy. At 8.20 p.m. the wire asking for clarification was sent. Trusting in his cousin’s ‘wisdom and friendship’, Tsar Nicholas suggested that the ‘Austro-Serbian problem’ be handed over to the Hague conference.

	A message announcing a general mobilization in Russia had been drafted and ready to be sent out by 9 p.m. Then, just minutes before it was to be sent out, a personal messenger from the Tsar arrived, instructing that it the general mobilization be cancelled and a partial one re-instituted. The Tsar wanted to hear how the Kaiser would respond to his latest telegram before proceeding. ‘Everything possible must be done to save the peace. I will not become responsible for a monstrous slaughter’.


Hollweg doing one thing and the Kaiser another?

The Counsellor of Legation in Stockholm to the 
Chancellor 

REPORT NO. 1484 

A3g974 Stockholm, 26 November 1917 

Subject: The situation in Petrograd. 

One's joy at the courage and determination of the Bolshevik 
government must not lead one to put too much faith in the 
optimistic claims for the duration of their government being 
made by the Bolsheviks here. For example, since Lenin's victory, 
the representatives here have asserted every day that the efforts 
to form a coalition with the other Socialist parties would un- 
questionably be successful in the very near future, and that this 
would secure the existence of the new government and ensure 
its ability to act. So far these efforts have not only been un- 
successful, but the very question of forming a coalition has led 
to violent differences amongst the Bolsheviks themselves and to 
the separation of a considerable number of their followers.


	...It is in the light of this situation that the usefulness of Gold- 
berg's activities, which were set in motion by Deputy Erzberger, 
must be judged. However correct the policy of agreement, which 
was laid down in the Reichstag on 1 9 July as a continuation of 
Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's policy, may be, 
it must not tempt one to adopt the idea that a rapprochement be- 
tween the German people and the Russian people — in the sense 
of friendship between peoples — should be initiated through 
negotiations between the majority parties and delegates of those 
now in power in Russia. It is this idea that Goldberg has thrust 
into the foreground. It would probably be a grave political error 
even to seem to bind the future of Russo-German relations to 
the fortunes of the men now in power in Russia. The duration 
of their government will bring no more than a cease-fire and 
possibly a formal peace. In the circumstances, and in view of the 
violent shocks which are in all probability still facing Russia, 
we shall not be able to take up proper peaceful communications 
and a friendly, neighbourly relationship once more until some 
considerable time has elapsed and a start is made in the gradual 
restoration of order. That will be the time to begin working for 
agreements, with the Russian people and with another Russian 
government, such as those Goldberg has in mind. Until then, 
only a cautious handling of commercial issues by representatives 
of the actual government will be possible or to the point, and 
only action of this kind will enable us to achieve a transition to 
good relations, even with a new government and a Russia which 
is not Bolshevik. Riezler 


Hollweg had idea of truce with Soviets? but others had doubts


https://books.google.com/books?id=1KO8DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT287&lpg=PT287&dq=%22Siegfried+Goldberg%22+%22Matthias+Erzberger%22&source=bl&ots=vQwQUNPxUq&sig=u2CCfYzUyXcrE99LMI5zbOmfjso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH8P6av9XWAhUB4SYKHQflB3sQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Siegfried%20Goldberg%22%20%22Matthias%20Erzberger%22&f=false

Sazanov was working with Erzberger and Goldberg on some peace efforts, said to have told them Lenin was the "real revolutionary leader."

	Lenin assumed that “it will not be possible to get away early from this 
damned Switzerland. ’’^ Yet German diplomats already were planning 
the return of Lenin to Russia. A few weeks later, the German 
Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, reported to the Emperor that 
“immediately” upon learning of the Russian revolution — he received 
this news during the afternoon of March 14 — he instructed the German 
Minister to Switzerland to offer the Russian exiles passage through 
Germany. It is not clear which channels were to be used ; the Germans 
had a large number of contacts. These included Dr. Kornblum who 
participated in the Bolshevik conference of 1915, and who at that time 
apparently was in contact with von Bismarck ; Buchholz, whom Lenin 
had known from Samara and Berlin ; Bagocki, who had been involved 
at Cracow and who soon became the executive secretary of a committee 
working for the return of the revolutionaries from Switzerland to Russia 
; Shklovsky, who during 1916 was one of the persons who transmitted 
money to Lenin. Also of importance in such work were the 
correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, Dr. Deinhard ; the German 
left-socialist Paul Levi ; the promotor of the Youth International and 
Lenin’s young German adherent, Willi Muenzenberg ; the Polish 
socialist and former German journalist, Karl Radek ; a Swiss socialist, 
Hermann von Boetticher ; finally, the several contacts which the 
military attache had among the international Mensheviks ; and, of 
course, Keskula and Moor. 

	It was indeed simple to plant the idea. Already in 1915 Parvus had 
dispatched Russian revolutionaries through Germany. The German 
military wanted Lenin to organize sabotage campaigns. On December 
29, 1916, Okhrana agent “Gretchen” reported that Lenin was still in 
Switzerland and would not leave via Germany : even if he were able to 
obtain the visa he would not use it — to avoid giving for a second time 
the impression of collusion with the Central Powers. It would be 
interesting to know the background of this perplexing “premature” 
document.

	At first the Germans remained passive observers of the revolutionary chaos: an offense on land, or by sea in the Gulf of Finland, might rally their enemy in defense of the homeland. Instead, they preferred to stoke the flames of revolt by helping exiled extremists return to Russia. OVer the previous eighteen months Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, the German minister in Stockholm, had built up a network of of agents in contact with Russian exiles in Switzerland, inclding the leader of the Bolshevik faction, Lenin. On the fall of the tsar, Brockdorff-Rantzau urged the authorities in Berlin to use the radical socialists 'to create the greatest possible chaos in Russia', a policy welcomed not only by Chancellor Bethmann Holweg but also by Ludendorff, who from August 1916 was the principal architect of German strategy. On his initiative a train was provided on 9 April to take Lenin and some thirty companions back from Berne to Sassnitz, on the Baltic coast. It was agreed that, during the journey, the Russians would have no contact with any German.

	Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg on the Effects of the Russian Revolution (March 28, 1917)

	The Russian Revolution in March of 1917 had an electrifying effect in Germany: it removed the Russian autocracy, the bogey that had persuaded the German Socialists to support the war in 1914. Also, the Russian experience furnished a model in practice of how economic issues, like bread shortages, could be exploited to bring democratic reform, and possibly an end to the war. Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (1856-1921) was keenly aware of this fact, as his note to an official in the foreign ministry makes clear. 

	For your personal information and appropriate temporary use.

	Efforts have already been made to influence the press along the lines ordered by His Majesty. I am paying all the more attention to this matter, because the Russian revolution naturally occupies the entire public intensely. The Social Democrats cannot be prevented from expressing their sympathy for the Russian revolutionaries; apart from the most radical wing, however, if my hopes are fulfilled, they can be prevented from comparing our situation with the Russian. The spread of antimonarchical tendencies does not seriously worry me for the time being. The position of the monarchy is strongly rooted in the broad masses of the people. A direct danger would, however, emerge if one were to label democratic demands, which are an unavoidable consequence of this war, simply as antimonarchical and if, as was common before the war, one were to recognize only the reactionaries as reliable pillars of the throne. Even military circles are going to have to convince themselves of this truth. A reactionary military dictatorship would lead us toward destruction. The course of events can make the satisfaction of democratic demands necessary during the war itself, in which case it is possible that the length of the war, the severity of sacrifice, and in the end developments in Russia, too, will make concessions appear insufficient that would have seemed adequate during the first year of the war. Without giving in to nervousness, one must be aware that a “too little” or “too late” can become fatal.

	v. Bethmann Hollweg.


Hollweg worried about "dangers to monarchy?" saying that if there wasn't reform, or if it were too little too late, it would be fatal. Seems to see a trend, driven by war, toward reform that is more than just "anti-monarchical." Hoped that German social democrats wouldn't compare their situation to Russia. Term "reactionary" has roots in French Revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary), so maybe that's what Hollweg meant by "reactionaries" being counted on for support of a "reactionary dictatorship."

Ok so basically he's saying don't overract, don't create a military dictatorship of reactionaries and dismiss those wanting democratic reform as "anti-monarchical."

Sounds like he knew Ludendorff's military dictatorship was going to give rise to problems (e.g. socialism).

	A reactionary military dictatorship would lead us toward destruction. The course of events can make the satisfaction of democratic demands necessary during the war itself, in which case it is possible that the length of the war, the severity of sacrifice, and in the end developments in Russia, too, will make concessions appear insufficient that would have seemed adequate during the first year of the war. Without giving in to nervousness, one must be aware that a “too little” or “too late” can become fatal.


And I guess this means he thinks the people could rise up against a "reactionary military dictatorship," maybe not so different from Russia. But would depend on how they handle it.

Meanwhile, he signs off on sending Lenin over to Russia.

also, what does he mean by "Efforts have already been made to influence the press along the lines ordered by His Majesty." and "if my hopes are fulfilled, they can be prevented from comparing our situation with the Russian." Does he claim he can control the press? Probably, it wasn't anyone friendly to Germany controlling the press.


------

From his book:


	dislike of Count Aehrenthal and the latter's method of conducting Austro-Hungarian policy. Even the devotion and determination with which the Russian Ambassador, Count Osten-Sacken, the type of the sound diplomat of the old school, threw himself personally into the maintenance of the traditional friendship between Russia and Germany could deceive no one as to the fact that more influential forces in St. Petersburg were carrying their hostility to the Monarchy of the Danube over to its ally, Germany.


talking about spread of bolshevism?

in intro sounds like he's complaining that Germany was encircled


	...Edward Grey refrained, as far as he personally was concerned, from showing any actually unfriendly feeling against Germany. It is even questionable whether he himself recognised the full force of the aggressive tendencies of the Franco-Russian policy.


what "aggresive tendencies" does he mean? Russia was having an arms build-up I guess

complains about England siding with France and Russia a lot


	...And if Germany saw a formidable aggravation of all the aggressive tendencies of Franco- Russian policy in England's pronounced friendship with this Dual Alliance, England on its side had grown to see a menace in the strengthening of the German fleet and a violation of its ancient rights in our Eastern policy. Words had already passed on both sides. The atmosphere was chilly and clouded with distrust.


that sounds right


	Finally the economic hostility of England to its German competitor had been given an acutely political character by our naval policy. And consequently Germany had, in my opinion, to W endeavour to reduce the main danger that it could not entirely remove (that danger being the alliance of France with Russia), by getting English support of this Dual Allliance restricted as far as possible. This made it necessary for us to try to come to an under- standing with England.

	The Emperor was entirely in agreement with this policy and even described it to me in more than one discussion as the only possible procedure and the one that he himself would pursue with every personal means in his power.


right, I think other sources say he wanted to break-up Russian-French alliance

did he think he's actions that ended up starting a war would break-up this alliance somehow?


	...It would not be going too far to say that the campaign of hate and contempt directed against us by the enemy during the war has drawn its munitions from this source as much as from Pan-Germanism.


saying some kind of subversion going on from "the enemy"?


	In general my efforts to put Government before party, which were the subject of so much criticism and contumely, had an ultimate object that I con- sidered as the principal goal of my internal policy and attainable by this method alone.


claims he put country over party (did he?)


	There could be no question to anyone who studied the matter without prejudice that Social Democracy combined its bitter struggle against historic fact and its countless Utopias, all alike economically and politically impossible, with important objects which were not only inspired by idealism but also adapted to the political and economic development of its world. Its followers, which it counted in millions, were principally recruited from a working-class which could claim to have done great things in the way of productive activities, and which was kept under very strict discipline by the economic organisations of the trades unions and the political organisations of the party. Only an erro- neous conception of the limitations of Government authority could cause anyone to suppose that such a power as this could be coerced by repressive measures.


same as above, seems to be saying cracking down on socialists was a bad idea


	The desire prevailing in various regions of the middle- class to keep Social Democracy permanently in the position of open hostility to the Realm and to the Government, even perhaps to drive it still further into such hostility, was not practical politics. It could not be reconciled with the responsibilities of a policy such as mine of a conservative and constructive character. I had already expressed my conviction to the contrary as Minister of the Interior when I, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the German Labour Congress, declared that the adaptation of the Labour movement to the existing order of Society was the most important task of the times. And not long after I repeatedly and emphatically argued in the same sense when bringing forward the Labour Councils Act, a piece of legislation that unfortunately came to nothing. During the war I have firmly followed the same line, if possible with even stronger emphasis.


claims he tried to stop this, but he failed.

not starting the war would have been one way to prevent it.


	There were continuous and considerable obstacles to every attempt to induce gradually the Social Democratic party to take a positive as distinct from a negative part in governmental responsibility. The negative attitude of Social Democracy towards Money Grants and Army Bills, its terroristic extravagances in wage disputes, its professions of internationalist tendencies, and its constant and most damaging attacks upon the Monarchy, made every statesman suspect to the mass of the middle-class who did not combat Social Democracy. The middle-classes had become partly convinced and partly accustomed to consider that the combating of Social Democracy at all times and on all occasions was the first requirement of sound statesmanship.


I think he's saying most German politicians overreacted to the socialist campaign


	...The spirit of Bismarck was always being invoked and that, too, although the most uncompromising adherents of his anti-Social Democratic policy could not possibly have ignored the change in conditions since his time. And if the Social ^Democrats themselves might excuse their bitterness by pointing to the persecutions that they had endured under the Act against Socialism, and to many a hard word in subsequent years, yet it was they themselves who played into the hands of their opponents and made it difficult to protect them from demands against them dictated by the spirit of auto- cracy and forced as exceptional legislation.


sounds like he noticed a divide-and-conquer/polarization thing going on in Germany

I guess this was kicked into overdrive with the Kapp Putsch, Versailles, Beer-Hall Putsch, 1919 Communist uprisings, etc. I guess it's a strat of just go back and forth with more and more insane partisan fighting until a group of extremists wins. Maybe Lenin used that to get Bolsheviks in power, and it looks like they used the same to get Hitler in power. So, possibly, Hollwegg may be referring to early stages of this in his own country.


Is this the act he was referring to?

https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/4/3/320/1837618/The-German-Act-against-Socialism

"The German Act Against Socialism"

signed in 1878

dunno what it did but apparently organized socialism was in Germany since at least then.

these organized for any sinister purpose? Okhrana was founded in 1880.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_revolutions_of_1848%E2%80%9349
	They were a series of loosely coordinated protests and rebellions in the states of the German Confederation, including the Austrian Empire. The revolutions, which stressed pan-Germanism, demonstrated popular discontent with the traditional, largely autocratic political structure of the thirty-nine independent states of the Confederation that inherited the German territory of the former Holy Roman Empire.


back to his book:


	...The confused and fluid condition of parties was most unfavourable to the conduct of foreign affairs. The external position of Germany, as I have described it, was far too serious to allow it to indulge in the luxury of heated internal conflicts which would be welcomed by an unfriendly foreign public opinion as evidence of weakness. For although political life requires an emancipated criticism both of men and of matters, yet a reckless extravagance in this respect must eventually run the risk of giving the appearance of political immaturity.


hinting at stability at home affecting war abroad.

so he knew all this, he knew that "democratic demands" were "an unavoidable consequence of this war," yet he started it anyway. Why?


	...Many of the speeches on this occasion, speeches that were bound to make and did make bad blood abroad to no purpose, cannot but make us wonder whether the perils of our external situation were sufficiently realised in these discussions of our foreign policy ; even though on the other hand such perils were frequently over- estimated on the occasion of debates of Army Bills. The people as a whole showed no inclination for Chauvinistic impulses. The public read neither Nietzsche nor Bernhardi. And as the candidly mate- rialist tendencies of the day found ample activity and satiety in a fabulous business prosperity, the public had no thought for conquest or for empire; while this fundamental current of opinion was expressed with sufficient accuracy in the policy of the various parties in spite of the nationalist campaign of some of their leaders. 


Saying leaders and public out of touch. Leaders more materialistic and nationalist, public didn't care about conquest or empire. But some of the political parties were more in touch with public.

What does he mean by "the public read neither Nietzsche nor Bernhardi"?

does he look down on the public (e.g. for not being as "sophisticated" in foreign policy as him?)


What does Hollweg think about Nietzsche and Bernhardi?

Bernhardi sounds like a war-mongering spy

Hollweg sounds pro-war in this exchange.

Hollweg shows he understands the dynamic that led to socialism and polarization in Germany, and that it was fomented by outside forces and that the war contributed to it. At the same time, he assured his foreign minister the socialists wouldn't emulate Russia while sending Lenin to Russia. Seemed content to blame it all on the generals after he acted to start the war.

pg 63 of hollweg book:

	These documents established the fact that Russia had used the presence of Sir Edward Grey in Paris in April, 1914, on the occasion of the visit of the King and Queen of England, in order to bring about the conclusion of an Anglo-Russian Naval Convention through the intermediary of the French Government. The object of this was, as Count Benckendorff wrote to M. Sassonow, " to substitute something tangible for the altogether too abstract and pacific funda- mental idea of the Entente." It was also shown that Grey readily accepted the Russian proposal that was warmly pressed on him by the French Government, and applied for and obtained the consent of the English Cabinet. Further, that by arrangement the military and naval authorities took over the negotia- tions while the Government stood on one side in order if necessary to be able to deny any political engagements.

	As soon as we heard of this we struck a warning note in a German paper, and instructed Prince Lichnowsky to indicate to Sir Edward Grey that we had reason to suspect disquieting developments.


I wonder which journalist did that?

pg 161

	...At last on the 1st of August, there seemed to be a ray of hope. The well-known Lichnowsky telegrams arrived in which Grey personally, and through his private secretary, again reopened the question of the neutrality of France in a Russo-German war, and that of England in a war of France and Russia against Germany. The Kaiser, on receiving this news, and in the presence of his military and political advisers, at once decided that the disadvantage of delaying military preparations must, without question, be faced in spite of the fact that the intelligence was not improbably erroneous. Our Ambassador received immediate instructions from me to grasp the hand which seemed to be stretched out to us. If England would guarantee the neutrality of France we would undertake no military action against France. The Kaiser telegraphed in the same sense to King George. But it was a mirage that at once melted away, an unexplained misunderstanding. The avalanche could no longer be avoided. The avalanche that has destroyed the Europe of our day.


what exactly is going on here? did he ignore the mediation proposal and instead just complain that England didn't guarantee the neutrality of France?


pg 118


	...The object was a Balkan Alliance exclusive of Serbia under the aegis of the Central Powers. The Serajevo incident was adduced as evidence that the conflict between Austria and Serbia was irreconcilable, and that the Monarchy must reckon with an obstinate and aggressive hostility from Serbia. The Emperor's manuscript summarised the argument briefly, and suggested that the pacific policy of the Powers was threatened if the agitation in Belgrade was left to itself. The Kaiser received both documents with the remark that he could only reply after consulting his Chancellor. On the after-noon of the same day the Kaiser received me and, the Under-Secretary of State, Zimmermann, who was representing the Secretary of State, von Jagow, then on leave. This was in the park of the new Palace at Potsdam. No one else was present. I had already made myself acquainted with the gist of the Austrian documents, a copy of which had been communicated to Herr Zimmermann. After I had reviewed their contents the Kaiser declared that he could not let himself be under any illusion as to the gravity of the position into which the Danube Monarchy had been brought by the Greater Serbia propaganda. It was not our business, however, to advise our ally what it must do in respect of the bloody deed at Serajevo. Austria-Hungary must settle that for itself. We must all the more abstain from any direct action or advice, as we must labour with every means to prevent the Austro-Serbian dispute developing into an international conflict. But the Emperor Francis Joseph must also be given to know that we would not desert Austria-Hungary in its hour of peril. Our own vital interests required the unimpaired maintenance of Austria. ...These views of the Kaiser corresponded with my own opinions.


says he didn't want it to become a wider conflict, but in backing Austria he did help it become a wider conflict. Also says he didn't want to do anything to stop the Austria-Serbia conflict.

He pins it on the Kaiser. But is that want the Kaiser actually believed?

------

pg 105 of his book he blames russia:

	It was for Russia to decide. Russian policy again had it in its power to find a peaceable solution of the Serbian issue. M. Sassonow had himself admitted in conversation with Count Pourtales that the Serbian Government had deserved a lesson, and a word from St. Petersburg would have sufficed to induce the Serbs to guarantee such satisfaction as would have contented Austria, and would have brought about a modus vivendi. While it would be all over with European peace if those in power at St. Petersburg had only ears for the commands of Russia's " historical mission," which, according to the ancient Pan-Slav formula, required not only the protection of the Balkan States but also the patronage of the Slav population of Austria. But we know to-day that a breach of the peace of Europe was just what M. Sassonow had in view because he wanted Constantinople, and therefore required a European War.


blames Sazanov and puts out the theory that Russia wanted the war to get Constantinople, echoing Bolsheviks.


	...But there was more to it than this. Both military and civil advisers had succeeded in persuading the Tsar in these critical days that he could only save his Crown and Empire if he could divert into war passions the growing discontent in his country, whether due to Pan-Slav excitement or Socialist resentment. Similar suggestions the experience of this war tempts one to say similar temptations of the devil may have misled every- where shortsighted and unprincipled persons in irre- sponsible quarters. But in Russia such persons were powers in high places. And those who influenced them were the determined adherents of the acquisition of Constantinople. It was to these war-hawks that M. Sassonow had handed himself over when he decided in consultation with them at that Conference of the 21st of February that Russia must seize the Straits, and could only do so at the cost of a European War.


claims the czar got bad advice, also that starting a war would redirect passions of socialism and discontent at home

so I guess this is supposed to be some amazing flash of insight from hindsight for him? if he suspected Russia wanted war earlier then he would have known he was helping them.


	...For M. Sassonow knew well enough when he said this to Sir G. Buchanan that M. Poincare", who as early as 1912 " had contemplated war without regret," would most certainly co-operate. He only wanted to know what England thought, because he could not make war against the will of England. Great Britain, allied as it was with Japan, had certainly resources enough for forcing Russia to give up all thought of war. M. Sassonow would only venture to open wide the gate of war, whose lock he had already picked, provided he could count on an arrned England taking its stand in the deadly breach. Everything depended on the attitude of England. And what did England do ?

	The possibility of war that had, of course, at once presented itself to Sir E. Grey, had evoked from the English statesman strong expressions of abhorrence. He recognised that even from an English standpoint the Austro-Serbian dispute did not in itself require international treatment. If the ultimatum to Serbia did not lead to a collision between Austria and Russia FlCngland had no cause to trouble about it. But he (did nothing to localise the conflict. From the begin- ning he took it as a matter of course that Russia would intervene, and counted on this. No sooner had Russia made the cause of Serbia its own than he accepted this. And not only that. Not only did he fail to use any such strong language in St. Petersburg as might still have been effective, but, on the contrary, he plainly gave the Russian Cabinet to understand that he was unwilling to use such language. He told Prince Lichnowsky on the 24th of July that he felt that in view of the form of the Austrian ultimatum he was quite powerless to exercise a restraining influence over Russia. The English states- man even thought it necessary to inform M. Paul Cambon beforehand of his intention to make this communication to the German Ambassador. Did Sir E. Grey imagine that Cambon would enshrine this interesting communication in the secrecy of his heart ? Did he not know perfectly well that his Russian colleague would have the benefit of it at once ? And that was all that Sassonow wanted to know.

	Volume ill focuses on very specifically on 

the War Chancellory of Bethmann-Hollweg. it is based on 

archival evidence, some ot the same used by Fritz Fischer, 

but Hitter's conceptualization ot his study, as well as his 

conclusions, are very different. Ritter calls for: 

...insight into the countless individual 
interrelation-ships that must be known if one is to 
understand the course of political events and do 
justice to the acts of commission and ommission of 



llu 



leading statesmen and soldiers, their successes as 
well as their lailures. (35) 

He places strong emphasis on the inability at Bethmann- 

Holweg, whom he sees as "an estimable statesman of 

character , "36 to rescue Germany from the throes of a 

hopeless war. The reason was not weakness of will, with 

which Bethmann-Holweg had been often charged, but a German 

militarism eni lamed with nationalist passion. "In wartime, 

politicians have always had a hard time gaining and 

maintaining authority against successful generals. "



Ritter says not Hollweg's fault but generals


https://archive.org/stream/FischerFritzGermanysAimsInTheFirstWorldWar/Fischer,%20Fritz%20-%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20Aims%20in%20the%20First%20World%20War_djvu.txt
	Fischer offers a very different pic- 
ture. He shows how the civilian government, and that meant in the 
first place Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg, was in deep sympathy 
with the general intent to fight the war in order to make Germany a 
‘world power’, equal to Britain and Russia. Bethmann Hollweg 
never questioned the need for drastic changes of the political map 
of Europe and the Europe-dominated Africa.


Fischer points out that Hollweg's aims come off as imperialist


	...This in turn leads to a re-assessment 
of the character of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, the Imperial 
Chancellor until the summer of 1917. Professor Fischer’s demonstra- 
tion that Bethmann was, as early as September, 1914, committed to 
a programme of widespread annexation has come as a shock to 
many people, for whom the Chancellor seemed to be a moderate 
and liberal figure attempting to stand out against the extreme de- 
mands of the militarists and ultra-nationalists.


doesn't seem shocking so far

this also helped Bolsheviks propaganda later (revealing imperialist war aims of Tsar and other European governments)


what was Hollweg's motivation?

	...Professor Fischer also shows us the full scope of the German activi- 
ties launched at the beginning of the war with the intention of sub- 
verting the enemy governments. The attempts to make the Moham- 
medans rise against their British, French and Italian colonial masters 
failed, as did the support of the Irish revolution. The greatest result 
this German policy of subversion achieved was in Russia. Originally 
directed upon making the non-Russian nationalities revolt against 
the Russian Tsardom the German operations did not produce a 
strong response. But when the Germans proceeded to back social 
revolution as well, the effect was world-shaking. By transporting 
Lenin from Switzerland to Russia and by giving further help to the 
Bolsheviks Germany was able to end the war in the east and to re- 
alize her maximum program of conquest through the peace treaties 
of Brest-Litovsk with the Ukraine and the Soviet Union as well as 
through the subsequent treaty with Rumania at Bucharest. 


Fischer also talks about German support for Lenin

	In the weeks before the outbreak of Armageddon, Bethmann Hollweg's secretary and confident Kurt Riezler made notes of the gloomy relish with which his master steered Germany and Europe into the abyss. July 7 1914: The Chancellor expects that a war, whatever its outcome, will result in the uprooting of everything that exists. The existing world very antiquated, without ideas.' July 27: 'Doom greater than human power hanging over Europe and our own people.' 30 Bethmann Hollweg had been born in the same year as Freud, and it was as though he personified the 'death instinct' the latter coined as the fearful decade ended. Like most educated Germans, he had read Max Nordau's Degeneration, published in 1895, and was familiar with the degenerative theories of the Italian criminologist Cesare Lom- broso. War or no war, man was in inevitable decline; civilization was heading for destruction. Such ideas were commonplace in central Europe, preparing the way for the gasp of approbation which greeted Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West, fortuitously timed for publication in 1918 when the predicted suicide had been accom- plished. 


Hollweg into some weird shit? I wonder what Riezler thought about it.

	...no one felt this pessimism more strongly than Reich Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg. He was, he confessed in 1912, 'gravely distressed by our relative strength in case of war. One must have a good deal of trust in God and count on the Russian revolution as an ally in order to be able to sleep at all.' In June 1913 he admitted to feeing 'sick of war, the clamour for war and the eternal armaments. It is hight time that the great nations quieted down again . . . otherwise an explosion will occur which no one deserves and which will harm all.' To the National Liberal leader Bassermann, he said 'with fatalistic resignation: "If there is a war with France, the last Englishman will march against us."' His secretary, Kurt Reizler, recorded some of his musings in his diary for 7 July 1914:

		The Chancellor expects that a war, whatever its outcome, will result in the uprooting of everything that exists. The existing [world] very antiquated, without ideas . . . Thick fog over the people. The same in all Europe. The future belongs to Russia, which grows and grows and weights upon an ever heavier nightmare . . . The Chancellor very pessimistic about the intellectual condition of Germany.

	On 20 July Bethmann returned to his Russian theme: 'Russia's claims [are] growing [along with her] enormously explosive strength . . . In a few years no longer to be warded off, particularly when the present European constellation persists.' A week later he told Rizler that he felt 'a fate [Fatum] greater than human power hanging over Europe and our own people'. That mood of near-despair, sometimes attributed by cultural historians to excessive exposure to the works of Nietzche, Wager and Schopenhaur, becomes more intelligible when the military realities of Europe in 1914 are considered.


Hollweg weird, says in 1912 Germany's only hope to survive war is in Russian revolution

also says "Bethmann himself increasingly gave way to fatalism: the death of his wife on 11 May 1914 can only have confirmed his sense of resignation."


https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/arms_race_prior_to_1914_armament_policy
	New weapons produced during the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s heightened existing tensions among European nations as countries strove to outpace their enemies technologically. This armaments race accelerated in the decade before 1914 as the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy squared off against the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Britain. Germany’s fears of increases in Russian armaments, and British fears of the German naval buildup, contributed heavily to the outbreak and spread of the First World War in 1914.

	...In short, none of the alliance leaders felt they lagged behind enemies and needed to catch up. They had no reason to believe an attack was imminent, but were confident that if one came they were well-equipped for success in battle. 

	...Two years later, Europe again came to the brink of war. In July 1911 a German gunboat anchored in a French Moroccan port, provoking another crisis. The war scare reverberated all summer, each side speaking of insults to national honor and the need to fight. It finally blew over in October without triggering the widely anticipated showdown between alliance blocs.

	Like the First Moroccan Crisis, however, serious consequences followed. In Germany, the Navy League, a pressure group for naval expansion, agitated for more ships. Furthermore, a new organization, the Army League, founded in 1912, similarly made propaganda for a massive increase in men and weapons. All patriots questioned whether Wilhelm II, German Emperor (1859–1941) was competently leading the nation and race. Feeling this pressure, the beleaguered emperor swore that next time, “I won’t chicken out.”


	...The Russian “Great Program” of June 1914 proved more worrisome in Berlin, however, for peacetime army size would rise 45 percent to 1,885,000 by 1917. Russian forces would also improve qualitatively by expanding rapid-firing field guns to 8,358, dwarfing Germany’s total of 6,004 in 1914. Chief of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke (1848-1916), was somewhat consoled that artillery strength per corps would still be greater, but all things considered, writes Norman Stone, “the pointers for the future were unmistakable.

	It was no surprise, therefore, that Moltke grew increasingly anxious, pressing Minister of War Erich von Falkenhayn (1861–1922) for another troop increase. Moltke even changed his mind from the year before, backing Ludendorff and Army League radicals who believed that only universal conscription, which already existed on paper but not yet in practice, could save the day. It became clear in May 1914 that no further increase could be squeezed out of a stingy parliament whose Left wanted no more consumer taxes, and whose Right was bitterly protesting the new 1913 federal taxes on wealth. In response, Moltke pleaded with the Kaiser:

		We must be aware that the offensive of almost the entire Russian army will be directed against our forces which remain in the east—to be precise, a Russian army which will, from 1917 onwards, probably already be fully outfitted and equipped in everything in a modern way, and which will be able to cross the border in the shortest time. ...We must not close our eyes to these facts that are so unfavorable to us!

	Getting nowhere with his plea made Moltke - one who had no illusions about the ferocity of modern warfare - eager to sound the tocsins while the odds favored Germany. “If only things would finally boil over,” he declared in early June 1914. “We are ready—the sooner, the better for us.”


so what was he (supposedly) thinking?

https://books.google.com/books?id=nAFfAr3dU_8C&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22One+must+have+a+good+deal+of+trust+in+God+and+count+on+the+Russian+revolution+as+an+ally%22&source=bl&ots=QfjTktDKQ8&sig=h3E_vNsnPZ1WQAsvRsLZuwOs9O8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwja767u89XWAhUCTCYKHXE5BfUQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=%22One%20must%20have%20a%20good%20deal%20of%20trust%20in%20God%20and%20count%20on%20the%20Russian%20revolution%20as%20an%20ally%22&f=false
	...Bethmen Hollweg could console himself with the thought that, given time, the Anglo-Russian alliance showed every likelihood of collapsing from within.

	Bethmann Hollweg's hopes were the stuff of Entente nightmares. Although Grey remained determined that Britain should retain a free hand, France could only endorse Sazanov's appeal in February 1914 that the Entente become a formal defensive alliance designed to deter Germany and Austria-Hungary. In April 1914 Grey agreed to the French suggestion that Russo-British naval conversations should take pace, a proposal to which the cabinet gave remarkably ready approval. The naval talks were of course secret, but a German agent in the Russian embassy in London passed on their details to Berlin. On 22 May the *Berliner Tagblatt* published the details, and on 11 June questions were asked in the House of Commons. Grey denied that Britain was under any obligations and denied that any negotiations were in progress-a technical truth in terms of treaty commitments, but a strategic fiction.

	Grey had feared that, if known, the naval conversations would confirm German fears of Russia and strengthen the hand of what he saw as the war party in Germany against that of Belthmann Hollweg. His worries were realized. Grey saw the German ambassador on 6 and 9 July, and insisted that, although staff talks had taken place, the governments of the Entente were not politically committed to one another. But such artfulness, 'seeking a compromise between isolationism and policy of alliance in order to gain the advantage of both at the same time', smacked of deceit. Grey hoped to appeal to liberalism in Germany and yet betrayed his own sense of democratic accountability by misleading parliament--or at least so it seemed to Bethmann Hollweg. For Bethmann the possibility of a German-British rapprochement as a basis for German overseas expansion was now gone; threatened too was the idea that each could manage its own alliance in the event of a crisis, as it had in November-December 1912.

	For more important, however, than these diplomatic setbacks was Germany's conviction that its encirclement was now complete. The fear which had accompanied German assertiveness gained the upper hand: the bull in the china-shop of European diplomacy began to see itself as a resigned sacrificial victim. For the Anglo-Russian naval talks gave the cue to the latent but pervasive Russophobia that gripped not only Bethmann Hollweg but also Motlke. The press and popular feeling played on the inevitability of a clash between Teuton and Slav. This emotive vocabulary did not seem inappropriate given the reality of the position. THe Russian army's budget-independently of the extraordinary capital grants--had grown from 406 million roubles in 1907/8 to 581 million in 1913/14. Spending on the navy nearly tripled over the same period, and in 1914 exceeded that of Germany. In 1913 the Russians introduced the 'grand programme', enacted in 1914, which aimed to increase the annual contingent of recruits for the army from 455,000 to 585,000, and to expand the total number of divisions from 114.5 to 112.5. The Russian war minister accompanied these enlargements with statements calculated to stoke German anxieties. THe German and Austro-Hungarian armies were already inferior to those of France and RUssia by over a million men in the sumer of 1914; by 1917 the Russian army alone would be three times the Size of Germany's. THe argument that, objectively, there was no chance of a RUssian challenge in economic terms did not figure in the calculations on the military balance. By 1914 French loans had enabled the construction of strategic railways so that RUssias mobilization could be accelerated, and the first troops be into battle within fifteen days. German plans drawn up on 1905 rested on the then-valid assumption that Germany would have six weeks in which to deal with France before turning east: the very existence of that planning assumption, which by 1913 was demonstrably wrong, added to Germany's sense of panic. In may 1914, therefore, Moltke's advocacy of a preventative war took on greater urgency, if not more precision: 'we must wage a preventative war', he told Gottlieb von Jagow, the foreign minister, 'to conquer our opponents as long as we still have a reasonable chance in this struggle.'

	Both Jagow and Bethmann Hollweg resisted Moltke's suggestion. But the case for doing so seemed, in the self-absorbed atmosphere of Wilhelmine politics, to be growing weaker. As early as December 1912 Bethmann--who had visited Russia in that year--confessed: 'One must have a good deal of trust in God and count on the Russian revolution as an ally in order to be able to sleep at all.' 



Hollweg knew Germany's chances were bleak, Russia was stronger, and that England would side with Russia, yet he played chicken with Russia and sabotaged England's warning anyway.

https://www.britannica.com/biography/Helmuth-Johannes-Ludwig-von-Moltke

Moltke, the guy who kept calling for "preventative war," goes on to do a terrible job commanding divisions in Western front. Died a few years later after abdicating.


from taylor:

	Moltke had hoped to knock France out of the war within six weeks and then throw the whole combined weight of the German and Austrian armies against Russia. His own errors of judgment and failure of nerve—he had weakened his striking force in the west to bolster the hard-pressed eastern front—helped to cheat him of the victory that was in his grasp. Stolid as an ox—and hardly more imaginative—the French commander-in-chief, General Joseph Joffre, retreated as best he could under the sledgehammer blows of the enemy, then sensing a slackening, lowered his head and butted back. The three-day French counterattack (September 6-9) on the Marne and along the Nancy-Verdun front, brilliantly improvised by Joffre’s subordinate commanders, shivered the German offensive.


https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/arms_race_prior_to_1914_armament_policy
	Recent seminal works by David Stevenson, David G. Herrmann, and Annika Mombauer have refined this discussion by emphasizing the desire of Moltke and other leading military and civilian officials to exploit the July Crisis in order to wage a “sooner the better” preventative war. 


Moltke might have been in the "pro-war" camp too

pg 131

	Billow in 1909 and Bethmann Hollweg in 1912 each expressed the view that wars were caused not by the ambitions of princes and politicians, but by the action of the press on public opinion. The evidence to support their belief was sparse.

pg 140

	Part of the apocalyptic vision of war entertained by Bethmann Holweg, by the Tsar, and by Grey rested on the assumption that war would not be accepted by the working class.


pg 110

	Thus, on the afternoon of 30 July Moltke bypassed Bethmann Holweg and urged Conrad to mobiilze against Russia, not Serbbia, and assured him that Germany would follow suit.

pg 107

	Bethmann Hollweg ws nonttheless slow to realize the gravity of the criss which confronted him. On 25 July Germany's ambassador in St. Petersburg had reported that Russia was not likely to be held back

pg 91

	What is striking about the 'blank cheque' is not that it was issued but that it was indeed blank. The council had made little effort to discuss the implications of what it was going. Its decisions followed from previous events rather than from a projection as to the future. Falkenhayn wrote to Moltke expressing the view that neither he nor Bethmann Hollweg beleived that Austria-Hungary would follow through the forceful language which it had so far employed. But Bethmann Holweg had done little to inform himself on precisely this point. When on 9 July he told the minister of the interior, Clemens von Delbruck, of the impending Austrian ultimatum he confessed that he had no idea of its contents; furthermore, so little was he disturbed by his own ignorance that he used it as a device to still Delbruck's alarm. The fatalism which had increasingly gripped the chancellor had become a device to ease him of responsibility for his actions. Later in the same month he was to express the view that 'a fate greater than human power hangs over the situation in Europe and over the German people'. The Kaiser too felt that the affairs of nations were beyond individual control and were subject to the inscrutable will of God. Thus, nobody in Germany attempted to guide and manage events in July 1914.

	Such an extraordinary abdication of responsibility is all the more remarkable in view of the fact that Bethmann Hollweg's calculations did not exclude the possibility of a major European war.



https://books.google.com/books?id=xFgTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=St.+Petersburg+had+reported+that+Russia+was+not+likely+to+be+held+back&source=bl&ots=nEfA55w05z&sig=ro4mWNteQRZqavT6wgeYrFQGqAE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwif_ozakdbWAhXDOiYKHexwCogQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=St.%20Petersburg%20had%20reported%20that%20Russia%20was%20not%20likely%20to%20be%20held%20back&f=false
	Any military preparations by Russia, even if designed to counter Austria-Hungary alone, would have been sufficient to prompt German mobilization. This is obviously true if Germany is seen as an aggressive power, already committed to European war, and certainly not disposed to pass up the opportunity of having its eastern frontier protected by Austrian operations against the Russians and so being freed to concentrate in the weest. But it is also applicable in the context of a more reactive interpretation, of Germany's self-imposed image as the tragic victim: the sense of being in a corner, the preoccupation with time which not only the mobilization timetable but also the political management of the crisis generated, combined with fear of Russia and the obligation to Austria-Hungary to make Russia's partial mobilization as intolerable to Germany as general mobilization.

	Bethmann Hollweg was nonetheless slow to realize the gravity of the criss which confronted him. On 25 July Germany's ambassador in St. Petersburg had reported that Russia was not likely to be held back by fear of domestic disorder. Despite this clear indication that the strategy of a short, sharp Austro-Serbian war would misfire, the German chancellor continued to pursue that objective.

	 The Army Intervenes in the Crisis: Helmuth J. L. von Moltke to Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (July 29, 1914)

	General von Moltke pushed for preemptive German mobilization against Russia. He accepted the likelihood that this step would bring the French into the fray. Moltke regarded a two-front war as inevitable. His thinking reflected a growing fatalism on the part of many military leaders who believed that Germany’s position had weakened steadily since the beginning of the century. 


apparently Hollweg subscribed to this fatalism idea?


Moltke certainly did. Is suspicious.

https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/riezler_kurt

Reizler had a diary presumably including some of the wierd shit Hollweg said/did

	From Riezler’s diary and correspondence the reader derives information about the intentions of the German leadership, the latter’s justification for a “preventive war” (Bethmann Hollweg to Konrad Haußmann, 1919), memoranda on war aims (“September Program”, Mitteleuropa under German hegemony), war crimes in Belgium, as well as the extensive annexation wishes of the German military, politicians, and entrepreneurs:

		The military […] wants to annex half the world (letter from 24 August 1914); […] it will be terrible after the war; the belief in violence that dominates so many people and the empty phrases that will be used (letter from 25 August 1914).[1] 



	... The July Crisis and the First World War

	The Reich chancellor’s policy in the summer of 1914 closely resembled that of Riezler’s – his advisor on political warfare in the Reich Chancellery – favored concept before the war of a “bluff” strategy:

		If a government, led astray by the bluff method, has ventured too far […], then it is perhaps no longer capable of retreating even when this would be the reasonable thing to do – the consideration of personal interests, the ambitions of governments or the anticipated storm of indignation by the nationalists can bring about war, something that factual concerns alone could not justify.[3]

	In July of 1914, Bethmann Hollweg did not consider an alternative, but rather accepted the belligerent escalation of his course of action. “If the war doesn’t come,” Riezler noted in an entry on 8 July 1914 in his subsequently assembled notes, “if the Tsar does not want it or advises a distraught France for peace, then this gives us the chance to break up the Entente.” In September 1914 Riezler drafted the “September Program.” To his fiancé he wrote, the “staging [was] very good. Incidentally, the war was not wanted, but still calculated and it broke out at the most opportune moment.”[4] He explained to Theodor Wolff (1868-1943), “undoubtedly Germany played a risky game out of fear. […] It is highly possible that because Russian willingness was underestimated, the game was thought to be less risky than it in fact was.”[5]


Hollweg "bluffing" with Russia, Reizler goes along with it, leads to war


from Taylor:

	Localized war was, in fact, the official catchword in Berlin and Vienna. The sooner it came, the better, according to the experts. 

	The bolder Austria became, and the more strongly she was supported, “the more likely Russia is to keep quiet,” said Herr Gottlieb von Jagow, the German Secretary of State (Foreign Minister).

	On this theory, Bethmann-Hollweg—a political lightweight a bare notch above Berchtold’s level—Jagow, and the German General Staff kept trying to prod Austria into hostilities before anyone could intervene. The intervention which they probably feared the most was that of their master, the Kaiser, and they took care that the information of the developing international crisis which reached him on board the Hohenzollern was as little, and as late, as possible. (One more illustration of how fictitious the Kaiser’s claim to supreme responsibility had become.) No direct German interests were involved in the dispute between Austria and Serbia. Berlin officialdom was trying to push Germany’s Austrian allies into war for their own good, and to strengthen the alliance. The Habsburg Empire was visibly crumbling, the Wilhelmstrasse argued; only military victory over the forces of South Slav irredentism could save it. To achieve this result the risk of a general European conflict had to be accepted.

Hollweg apparently advocated playing chicken with Russia, Sazanov doing the same for Germany on the other side

	Riezler (1882-1955) was a professional diplomat who worked in the press department of the German Foreign Office.  He greatly admired and sometimes collaborated with the Imperial German Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, and Riezler was one of the very few people to whom the chancellor spoke freely on the eve of the First World War.  The surviving entries from Kurt Riezler’s diary offer perhaps the best insight into the thinking of Germany’s head of government during the July Crisis.


claims Riezler admired Hollweg



http://digifindingaids.cjh.org/?pID=2737638
	After writing works on classical Greek economics, he became a foreign affairs writer for the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung in 1906. The following October he was hired by the Foreign Office Press Chief, where he attracted the notice of Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, eventually becoming his advisor. In August 1914 Riezler joined the chancellor at the German headquarters in Luxemburg. He worked for the chancellor for several years, most notably drafting the September Program, a plan outlining Germany's postwar plans.


	...By January 1915 the tone of Riezler's letters had edged somewhat more pessimistic than the tone of several months prior. Letters in January mention a New Year's visit by the Kaiser to his troops. Several later letters reference troop movements on the Eastern front, such as the actions of the Austrians in Serbia or Croatia, and future worries about the plans of the Russians. Some letters mention interactions with other political figures or advisors to the German Chancellor, such as August von Trott zu Sulz. Military actions such as the U-boat blockade of England are also mentioned. In April 1915, Kurt Riezler suggests to Kaethe that they marry as soon as possible.

	One folder holds letters from Kurt Riezler in Moscow to Kaethe Liebermann. These letters describe the city and its changed circumstances after the Bolshevik Revolution. Riezler commented on the collapse of the city bourgeoisie and observed the rich and the nobility begging on the street, but also attended the opera, ballet, and theatre while there. While in Moscow he often sent packages to Kaethe of goods such as coffee, tea, furs, and soap.


what did he think of Bolshevik revolution?


Rizler wrote this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septemberprogramm

creating evidence for Germany's imperial war aims. His diary was also used by Fischer to the same effect.

Reddit post claims Brest-Litovsk cited as reason for Treaty of Versailles, I guess for assigning expansionist motives to Germany. "September program" document by Reizler also used to assign war guilt to Germany, but that was released at a later time and cited by Fischer well after WWII.



What's up with September program? is it a legitimate document? why not discovered until later?


https://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/ralph/workbook/ralprs34.htm

kindof reminds me of Tanaka Memorial and protocols


http://roadstothegreatwar-ww1.blogspot.com/2015/11/septemberprogramm-vsbrest-litovsk.html
	Septemberprogramm (German for September Program) was a plan drafted by the German leadership in the early weeks of the First World War. It detailed Germany's ambitious gains should it win the war, as it expected. The plan was never officially adopted or put into practice and was only discovered long after the war by historian Fritz Fischer, who concluded the expansionary goals were Germany's motives for going to war in the first place. That interpretation has been very controversial. The modern consensus is that it was more of a discussion document and not a formally adopted government policy.


still, if it is active measures, and Riezler wrote it, why not have it "surface" earlier? (say ahead of Versailles treaty).

Questionable if Riezler wrote it at all.

Could also be the kind of thing where it can be used to a greater effect after all the people involved/with knowledge of the document are dead. Like if it was "more of a suggestion"/talking points and not a secret plan to take over the world, it would make sense to wait until it would be easier to construe the document as a serious and secret plan to take over the world.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septemberprogramm
	The Septemberprogramm was based on suggestions from Germany's industrial, military, and political leadership.[5][6] However, since Germany did not win the war, it was never put into effect. As historian Raffael Scheck concluded, "The government, finally, never committed itself to anything. It had ordered the September Programme as an informal hearing in order to learn about the opinion of the economic and military elites."



https://archive.org/stream/FischerFritzGermanysAimsInTheFirstWorldWar/Fischer,%20Fritz%20-%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20Aims%20in%20the%20First%20World%20War_djvu.txt
	Bethmann Hollweg included the plan of creating a ‘continuous 
central African colonial empire’ in his September programme, and 
this ambitious overseas programme continued thereafter to hold a 
permanent place among Germany’s war aims. 

	...The last part of this sentence shows that the Chancellor was already 
influenced by the reverse on the Marne. Nevertheless the special 
significance of the September Programme for the history of the de- 
velopment of Germany’s intentions during the First World War lies 
in two points. First, it was no isolated inspiration of the Chancellor’s: 
it represents the ideas of leading economic, political-and also mili- 
tary-circles. Secondly, the main ideas set forth in it remained, as we 
shall see, the essential basis of Germany’s war aims right up to the 
end of the war, although modified from time to time to fit changing 
situations. 


Fischer says sep program was permanent part of German war aims

Fischer controversy very negative on Hollweg, then Erdman publishes a portion of Reizer diary.

Fritz Stern says:

	The legend of German innocence and Bethmann Hollweg's irenic passion has been effectively exploded.


Seems right as far as I can tell. But why is he saying this? why does he care?


	...Wat Germany did and Bethmann Holweg said has now been quite thoroughly investigated--thanks to the impetus given by Fritz Fischer and Egmont Zechlin.


Likes Fischer?


	...Bethmann's thoughts and aspirations are difficult to reconstruct because his private papers were destroyed in 1945. The best remaining source is the diary of his longtime political assistant and secretary, Kurt Riezler, which I have been allowed to read and which is the principal source for these reflections.


What kind of shit is this

https://archive.org/stream/OriginsOfTheFirstWorldWar/OriginsOfTheFirstWorldWar-DavidE.Kaiser_djvu.txt
	Wolfgang Mommsen, while supplying many correctives to more extreme interpretations, has concluded that war broke out largely because the German government failed to function effectively in 1914, leaving Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg unable to resist the influence of the military.


But he started the war (as far as I can tell) by doing sketchy shit behind others backs without "the influence of the military." He did like to blame the military though.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Mommsen
	In Mommsen's view, the foreign policy of the Second Reich was driven by domestic concerns as the German elite sought distractions abroad to hold off demands for democracy at home. This argument places Mommsen in the Primat der Innenpolitik (primacy of domestic politics) school against the traditional Primat der Aussenpolitik (primacy of foreign politics) school as an explanation for foreign policy. For Mommsen, the major responsibility for the outbreak of the First World War rests on Germany's shoulders. Furthermore, the November Revolution of 1918 did not go far enough and allowed the pre-1918 elite to continue to dominate German life, thus leading inevitably to the Third Reich. Mommsen has written books condemning appeasement.

https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/inevitable-world-war/#!
	From the 1920s to 1960s, a loose consensus reigned among historians that like a toxic and volatile stew that shattered its cauldron, but for which there was no single chef, the war was a tragic accident. This interpretation was demolished by the work of Fritz Fischer, whose book War of Illusions announced that Germany planned for and sought such a war. Elaborating on his earlier, and earthshaking work, Germany’s Aims in the First World War, Fischer argued that war was inevitable ever since 1912, when the so-called German “war cabinet” met and concluded that Germany had to go to war before it was outmatched by Russian troops and hardware.

	Widening the Fischerian angle, another German historian, Wolfgang Mommsen, argued that the cascade of crises, from partial mobilizations to regional wars to popular panics since the start of the century, had, by 1914, reached a kind of critical mass. Describing what he calls “a topos of inevitable war,” Mommsen concluded that, by sheer repetition of recurring emergencies, a sense of fatalism had settled on both the principal actors and their populations. War came because most Europeans thought it had to come.


Mommsen a little iffy

weird writing style also


https://web.archive.org/web/20040709215112/http://www.pbs.org/greatwar/historian/hist_mommsen_02_versailles.html
	All of a sudden, we are confronted with what the bulk of the Germans considered an entirely unjust treaty. So resistance against this Treaty was enormous. I think that the strongest resistance concerned the territorial concessions in the East. Nobody was willing to concede that much territory to the new Polish State. Nobody was willing to accept willingly the system of reparations.


I thought it was more the "war guilt," humiliation and economic strain that the public disliked...


	..."Basically, I think one can say the Treaty was harsh, but understandable. It created in Germany a political climate in which it was exceedingly difficult for a democratic system to develop. Somewhat less harsh treaties certainly would have been good, on the other hand. The allied governments were under the pressure of their own public, which demanded the Germans to pay for it all.


this doesn't sound right.


https://web.archive.org/web/20171004072321/http://mrdoran.net/uploads/3/1/6/7/3167511/domestic_factors_in_german_foreign_policy.pdf

http://mrdoran.net/uploads/3/1/6/7/3167511/domestic_factors_in_german_foreign_policy.pdf
	In a way, Bethmann Hollweg deliberately discounted public opinion in matters of foreign policy, but he could afford to do so only if all sections of the government were willing to take a common stand on controversial issues vis-avis public opinion. The chancellor, hwoever, became less and less capable of seeing that his principle was ahdered to .

	The chancellor believed that the only way out was to conduct foreign policy in almost absolute secrecy, holding back from the public at large, and even from the party leaders, all but the most elementary information.  Bethmann Hollweg was fully aware that be doing this he exposed himself to vicious attacks from Convservatives and extreme nationalists alike, as his polic inevitably appeared to ousiders inconsistent and weak.


sounds like an excuse.


	...By far the most serious challenge to Bethmann Holweg's foreign policy came, however, from the General Staff. The military leaders were extremely concerned about the prospect that thr main premise of the Shclieffen Plan, namely, a slow Rusisan mobilization which would allow the Germany Army to crush France before the Russians became an effective military danger, was being undermined by the progress of Russian armaments, and in particulary by th eccompletion of the railways in western Russia. Their apprehensions were not reduced by the rather ambiguous reaction to press charges that Russia was preparing a war against Germany.


Sounds like what Moltke was saying. If this is what they believed, it conveniently allows the Russian government to decide when Germany starts a  war.


	...The political calculation of the German governemtn amounted to gambling with very high stakes indeed. Bethmann Holweg himself called it a "leap in the dark" which was dictated by the "most severe duty." The chancellor's position was no longer strong enough to get any alternative accepted by the inner ring of the ruling elite. his pla was a fairly precise reflection of the deep division within the government itself. It was a compromise between two rival schemes. It did not directly work for war; rather, it favored a diplomatic solution of the crisis. Still, it satisfied the request of the military establishment insofar as it did noting to avoid war.


sounds like an excuse


	The attempt to maneuver Russia into a position in which *she* would have to decide about peace or war was not dictated only by the considerations that otherwise the Social Democrats might not rally behind the government. It was equally influenced by the calculation that only in this way could the forthcoming crisis by exploited diplomatically, and with the afterthought that, provided the Russians shrank back from extreme measures, the fears of the German General Staff could be positively disproved.


wasn't Hollweg warned that the Russians wouldn't back down?


	...In the last analysis, we may conclude, the causes of the First World War must be sought not in the blunders and miscalculations of the governments alone, but in the fact that Germany's governmental system, as well as Austria-Hungary's and Russia's, was no longer adequate in the face of rapid social change and the steady advance of mass politics.

	...The imperial empire under William II, on the one hand, contributed to the chaos, for German troops occupied considerable parts of the former tzar empire. But at the same time the diplomats of His Majesty invested millions to keep the Bolsheviks in Central Russia in power, because only these were ready to accept a German victory-peace, and because no one in Berlin believed that a real socialism would come to its feet.

	"The Bolsheviks are great fellows, and have made everything very beautiful and well done so far," wrote Diplomat Kurt Riezler, who at that time decisively determined the German policy on Russia.

	It is unlikely to be clear how much money the imperial Germany at the end of 1917 gave the Bolsheviks. There was no doubt that there were considerable amounts. In the archive of the Federal Foreign Office you can find an amazing document. On November 25, 1917, the Foreign Minister's liaison officer telegraphed to Berlin at the headquarters in Bad Kreuznach:

		"The current Petersburg government is struggling with great difficulties, banks denying it any financial support that their government needs urgently to obtain the food for the people and the army ... Is it possible for her to meet the urgently needed money of the difficulties and her slogan in the people and the army, it will be able to hold itself until the armistice is closed, which is what Lenin has recognized, so he turns to us ... Supreme Army leadership considers it highly desirable if the Lenin government succeeds in making money. "

	The Federal Foreign Office backed out: "Further financial support for the Bolsheviks is needed." A few days later, Riezler maintained that the Bolsheviks "now have money". 


http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/books/chapters/reds.html
	On January 9, 1915, the German ambassador to Constantinople, H. Wangenheim, reported to Berlin that he had been approached by a Dr. Alexander Helphand, who was "definitely pro-German" and who advocated "the total destruction of czarism and the division of Russia into smaller states." Germany would be successful, said Helphand, if it "kindled a major revolution in Russia.... The interests of the German government were therefore identical with those of the Russian revolutionaries." Helphand offered to organize the rising but would need considerable sums of money and wanted to present his plan to Berlin.

	The Germans were willing to consider any plan to destabilize Russia and take her out of the war. Helphand was summoned to Berlin on March 6. He saw Kurt Reizler, an aide of Chancellor Theobald Bethmann-Hollweg, to whom he gave an eighteen-page memorandum entitled "Preparations for Mass Political Strikes in Russia." Helphand proposed that the Germans subsidize a splinter group of the Social Democratic Worker's Party, who called themselves "The Majority" (Bolsheviks), and whose leader, Lenin, lived in Switzerland in exile. His plan was quickly approved: the next day Arthur Zimmerman, an undersecretary in the Foreign Ministry, asked the Treasury for 2 million marks to fund Russian revolutionary propaganda, half of which was turned over to Helphand.


Parvus met Reizler and gave him his plan which was "quickly approved"

dunno about source though

	It is conceiable that Lenin, alleging upon disembarking from the platform that he was Platten, did confer with German officials. If so, it is possible that he saw Kurt Riezler, Bethmann's assistant for political warfare. Riezler later told a friend that he had sent an emissary to the train but that the talk took place only on the ferry Between Germany and Sweden.




https://archive.org/details/Germany-and-Revolution-in-Russia-1915-1918
	In November 19 14 it became clear to Germany's leaders that 
they had failed to achieve a decisive victory in the first phase 
of the war. The transformation of the war in the West and in 
the East into a one-front engagement was, according to Falken- 
hayn, the Chief of the General Staff, the shortest way to victory. 1 
It could be effected only if Germany concluded peace with one 
of the principal partners of the Entente. 

	Zimmermann, the Under State Secretary in the Foreign Min- 
istry, concurred with this opinion in a memorandum dated 27* 
November. 2 He wrote : 'The aim of our policy in this war, con- 
ducted with such uncommon sacrifice, must be not only an hon- 
ourable, but also a lasting peace. In order to achieve this aim 
I regard it as desirable that a wedge should be driven between 
our enemies, so that we may conclude an early separate peace 
with one or the other. 5 In the subsequent years of the war, to 
isolate one of the enemy powers and conclude a peace with it 
was the principal aim of the German foreign policy.

	Behind this policy there was a tremendous profusion of 
activity and confusion of thought. The Foreign Ministry, 
having lost its peace-time functions, took over its management. 
The German missions in the neutral countries were the Minis- 
try's busiest outposts. Politicians, journalists, members of noble 
families, university professors, directors of banking houses, in- 
dustrialists, cranks, and crooks were involved. Large amounts of 
money were spent by the government in order to achieve this 
aim.

	France and Russia were the most likely targets for the policy 
of separate peace. But in Russia, apart from the possibility of 
concluding peace with the established regime, there was another 
way open to Germany. This was to give support to the revolu- 
tionary movement, to weaken the existing regime not only by 
military defeats but also by disruptive revolutionary agitation, 
both nationalist and socialist, and finally to conclude peace with 
a government dependent upon German good-will.

	...It was Dr. Helphand,2 alias Parvus, by origin a Russian Jew, 
a Social Democrat who attempted to stand above the 
Bolshevik-Menshevik controversy, who did much to attract 
the attention of the German government to the possibilities of 
a revolution in Russia. From the spring of 19 15 till November 
191 7, Helphand played the most important part in Germany's 
relations with the Russian revolutionary movement, in spite of 
the fact that some socialists distrusted him, and that he may 
have been by-passed when the various German agencies 
acquired their own contacts.

	...Although the centre of political power had shifted, at the 
outbreak of the war, from Berlin to the seat of the Highest Army 
Command, it was the Foreign Ministry, and not the General 
Staff, who played the leading role in the policy of support of 
the revolutionary movement. It was pursued with the approval, 
and, in broad outline, with the knowledge of the highest mili- 
tary levels, and in co-operation with the Political Section of the 
Deputy General Staff in Berlin/ The Political Section, first 
under Nadolny and later with Hiilsen at its head, played an 
important part in the implementation of this policy. But the 
initiative came, most of the time, from the Foreign Ministry.


funny that the only funding the Bolsheviks could find was from people bent on seeing Russia destroyed


	...The support of the left wing of the Russian revolutionary 
movement, political and financial, was the policy of the Foreign 
Ministry throughout the war. It was initiated while Jagow 
was the State Secretary, and Zimmermann the Under State 
Secretary in the Auswartiges Amt; it was carried on, more 
intensively, by Zimmermann after Jagow's resignation and later 
by Kuhlmann, who saw its consummation and decline in the 
final stages of the war. 


Foreign Ministry under Bethmann Hollweg primarily responsible. Zimmerman and Jagow being SoS, then Kuhlmann at end.


	...It was a policy beset by difficulties. The servants of the 
German state had to deal, however indirectly, with un- 
pleasant facts of revolution, with the demi-monde of revolution- 
aries in exile, and also with the subtle distinctions among the 
various revolutionary groups. Minister Diego Bergen, the trusted 
official in Wilhelmstrasse, the central office of the Foreign 
Ministry, who, after the Great War, served both the Weimar 
Republic and Hitler's regime as Ambassador to the Holy See, 
dealt with this policy efficiently from the beginning of 1 915 till 
the end of 191 7. He was in constant touch with Helphand, 
but not entirely dependent on him; he could distinguish be- 
tween the more and less effective types of revolutionaries and 
he took them for what they were : enemies of the Tsarist regime 
and advocates of the cessation of hostilities and peace. 


This guy Diego Bergen also closely involved.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_von_Bergen

the guy who helped install Lenin also wanted a fascist pope


	...The policy bore the mark of the highest security rating; 
its outline becomes clear from the documents printed in this 
volume. Its implementation, carried out by many agents, is 
obscure to a degree. Often the search in the archives of the 
Foreign Ministry is unrewarding: the words 'the matter was 
settled by word of mouth' appear too often. As few records as 
possible were made; it is surprising that so large a number of 
relevant documents were recorded and preserved. This is 
often due to the urgency of the matter in hand : the amount 
of documents for April and November of 1 9 1 7 is higher than 
for any other period. The return of the political emigres after 
the March revolution and the German reaction to the Bolshevik 
seizure of power were matters urgent to both parties involved. 
In more tranquil periods, the men involved could be sum- 
moned to Berlin for consultations. No record of these talks was 
preserved. 

	Some of the men who took part in the formulation of German 
war-time policy recorded their experiences. But the memoirs of 
I.udendorff, Kuhlmann, Hoffmann, or Erzberger 1 do not en- 
lighten the reader much as to the official attitude towards the 
revolution in Russia. They may have been unaware of the 
consistency of the policy as Bergen conducted it; they may 
have regarded it as an incident which should remain hidden in 
the government archives, or they may have just forgotten. Kiihl- 
mann certainly knew about it but chose to be uninformative 
in his memoirs. Ludendorff, when referring to Lenin's journey 
across Germany, did so with 'bated breath'. 


deleting records


	...There is no evidence among the documents of the Foreign 
Ministry that Lenin, a circumspect man, was in direct contact 
with any of the official German agenicies. How much he knew 
about the activities of the men around him is difficult to tell. 
Hanecki, alias Fiirstenberg, and Radek, both officially Austro- 
Hungarian subjects, did, as well as Helphand, have some 
contacts with the Germans. 1 But it cannot be said even about 
Radek and Fiirstenberg, who had more contacts with the 
Germans than anyone else among the Bolsheviks, that the 
interests of the Imperial German government lay close to their 
hearts. A socialist revolution was their aim. To achieve and 
further it they were prepared to use every means.


Germans using Bolsheviks, Bolsheviks using Germans


	...It includes the transport of the Russian 
revolutionaries through Germany. Lenin's contingent was the 
first of these transports; later, a number of them was organized 
from Switzerland and Belgium. The criterion the German 
government used for their approval was the attitude of the men 
who were to be allowed transit through Germany to the question 
of continuation of the war.

	TELEGRAM NO. 40 

	A 1451 General Headquarters, 13 January 1915, 12.20 a.m. 

	Received: 13 January, 1.43 a.m. 

	We intend to send Riezler 1 to meeting with Russian Revolution- 
ary Parvus in Berlin with more detailed instructions. Please 
telegraph time of Parvus's arrival to me here. Parvus must not 
know that Riezler comes from General Headquarters. 

	Jagow 

	1 Kurt Riezler, born 1882. In May 191 3 Riezler became a Permanent Assistant 
in the Foreign Ministry. In August 1914 he was detailed to attend the Kaiser at 
the General Headquarters. In January 1915 he was transferred to the Imperial 
Chancery. In September 191 7 Riezler went to the Legation in Stockholm as a 
Counsellor to run the newly created Russian section there. In April 1918 he was 
recalled to Berlin, and in the same month he left to work with Count Mirbach, the 
Minister in Moscow. After Mirbach 's assassination in July Riezler carried on the 
business of the Legation until his recall to Berlin at the end of August 1918. 



Jagow says to send Riezler to meet up with Parvus and plot some more.

All these people are sketchy. Jagow was the one who called up Vienna and told them to ignore British mediation proposals.

This telegram in reponse to proposition to talk with Parvus


	The Minister in Copenhagen to the Under State Secretary 
	August 1915 

	Your Excellency, 

	Dr. Helphand, with whom I have recently had repeated and 
detailed conversation, yesterday told me that he had received 
a telegram from Arthur Cohn's Verlag fur Sozialwissenschaften 
in Munich, informing him that only the first part of his essay had 
arrived. With the permission of the Foreign Ministry, I had sent 
three further instalments, but these have not yet arrived in 
Munich. Dr. Helphand is worried because he is afraid that the 
essay may appear too late and not, as he intends, by i September 
at the outside. Perhaps Your Excellency could make sure that 
the dispatch of the manuscripts is undertaken *at once*. 

	I have now got to know Helphand better, and I think that 
there can be no question that he is an extraordinarily important 
man whose unusual powers I feel we *must* employ for the dura- 
tion of the war and should, if at all possible, continue to use later 
on — whether we personally agree with his convictions or not. 
He has a plan, conceived on a grand scale...

	...It *might perhaps* be risky to want to use the powers ranged behind Helphand, but it would *certainly* be an admission of our 
own weakness if we were to refuse their services out of fear of not 
being able to *direct* them. 

	I have not yet abandoned this hope. 

	Those who do not understand the signs of our times will never 

	I understand which way we are heading or what is at stake at this 
moment. 

	Your Excellency, this moment is too grave for us to indulge 
in sentimentality, so let me close. 

	Yours, &c., 

	Brockdorff-Rantzau

	The Minister in Bern to the Chancellor 

	Bern, 30 September 1915 

	The Estonian Keskiila 1 has succeeded in finding out the con- 
ditions on which the Russian revolutionaries would be prepared 
to conclude peace with us in the event of the revolution being 
successful.


Hollweg apparently interested in using Russian revolution to get separate peace since 30 September 1915


	According to information from the well-known 
revolutionary Lenin, the programme contains the following 
points : 

	1 . The establishment of a republic. 

	2. The confiscation of large land-holdings. 

	3. The eight-hour working day. 

	4. Full autonomy for all nationalities. 

	5. An offer of peace without any consideration for France, 
but on condition that Germany renounces all annexations 
and war-reparations. 

	On Point 5, Keskiila has observed that this condition 
does not exclude the possibility of separating those national 
states from Russia which would serve as buffer states.


Hollweg also thinking about dissolving Russian empire at this time as well


	6. The Russian armies to leave Turkey immediately — in 
other words, a renunciation of claims to Constantinople 
and the Dardanelles. 

	7. Russian troops to move into India. 

	I leave open the question as to whether great importance 
should in fact be attached to this programme, especially as 
Lenin himself is supposed to be rather sceptical of the prospects 
of the revolution. He seems to be extremely apprehensive of the 
counter-campaign recently launched by the so-called Social 
Patriots. According to Keskula's sources, this counter-move- 
ment is headed by the Socialists Axelrod, Alexinsky, Deutsch, 
Dneveinski, Mark Kachel, Olgin, and Plekhanov. They are 
unleashing vigorous agitation, and are supposed to have large 
financial resources, which they appear to draw from the govern- 
ment, at their disposal. Their activities could be all the more 
dangerous to the revolution as they are themselves old 
revolutionaries, and are therefore perfectly familiar with the 
techniques of revolution. In Keskiila's opinion, it is therefore 
essential that we should spring to the help of the revolutionaries 
of Lenin's movement in Russia at once.


Romberg telling Hollweg they should "spring to the help of the revolutionaries of Lenin's movement in Russia at once."


	He will report on this 
matter in person in Berlin. According to his informants, the 
present moment should be favourable for overthrowing the 
government. More and more reports of workers' unrest are 
being received, and the dismissal of the Duma is said to have 
: 1 roused universal excitement. However, we should have to act 
quickly, before the Social Patriots gain the upper hand. 

	I have the honour to enclose two agitationary publications of 
the Social Patriots, which they are supposed to be distributing 
in enormous quantities. 2 

	Even if, as I have said, the prospects of a revolution are un- 
ccrtain and Lenin's programme is therefore of doubtful value, 
ils exploitation could still do invaluable service in enemy terri- 
tory. If skilfully distributed it could, in my opinion, be especially 
effective in France, in view of the notorious ignorance of the 
French in foreign, and particularly Russian affairs. If I receive 
no instructions from Your Excellency to the contrary, I shall 
give it to various French confidential agents for distribution 
iniong the ranks of the opposition. I can imagine that, by 
opening the prospect of a separate peace between Germany and 
the Russian Democrats, which would, of course, involve the loss 
of the French billions, one could provide the opposition with 
hi extremely valuable trump card to play against M. Delclasse 
Mid in favour of a separate peace with us. 3 


suggests spreading some Leninist propaganda in Francce.


	Lenin's programme must not, of course, be made public, first 
because its publication would reveal our source, but also be- 
i ause its discussion in the press would rob it of all its value. 

	I feel that it should be put out in an aura of great secrecy, so that 
it creates a belief that an agreement with powerful Russian 
■ ircles is already in preparation. 

	Quite apart from the French aspect, I would ask you first of 
.ill to discuss this information with Keskiila, so that nothing 
may be spoiled by premature publication. R 

	' Keskiila was a member of the Estonian National Committee, working, in 
iu ii/.ri land and in Sweden, for the independence of his country from the Russian 
I mpire. He was in contact with the German Legation in Bern from September 
i i|i .|. Later, he worked with Steinwachs, the German agent (see document No. 12). 

	In April 1 91 7 Keskiila apparently negotiated with the representatives of the Allied 
countries, especially of England and Russia, in Stockholm. When he got to know 
about these negotiations, Steinwachs dropped him. His activities are well docu- 
mented in one of the Bern mission files, entitled 'Keskiila'. Cf. O. H. Gankin and 
H. H. Fisher, The Bolsheviks and the World War, Stanford University Press, 1 940, 
p. 249. 

	2 Only one of these enclosures remains in the file, the other was lost. It is a collec- 
tion of essays entitled 'Voina'; Axelrodand Plekhanov were two of the contributors. 

	3 Jagow's marginal note: 'I regard a distribution in France as dangerous; 
nothing ever remains discreet there. If this became public our work in Russia 
would become much more difficult, and the measures against the revolutionaries 
would be tightened. I shall telegraph Romberg to this effect.' The telegram (No. 
1081) was dispatched on 4 October (Russland Nr. 61, volume 123). 


Jagow says he wants to keep the work in Russia for the revolutionaries secret.







	The Minister in Copenhagen to the Chancellor 

	21 December 1915 

	Dr. Helphand, who returned from Berlin yesterday, visited me 
today and gave me his report on the results of his journey. He 
emphasized that he had been extremely civilly received in all 
the most important government offices, and that he had been 
given the definite impression that his suggestions had found 
approval with authoritative circles, both in the Foreign 
Ministry and in the Treasury.

	...Dr. Helphand continued by saying that about 20 million 
roubles would be required to get the Russian revolution com- 
pletely organized. This total could not possibly be distributed 
.11 once, as there would then be a danger of its source being dis- 
covered. However, in view of the fact that the beginning of the 
action was imminent, he had suggested at the Foreign Ministry 
l hat the sum of one million roubles should at once be put at the 
disposal of his confidential agent. This confidential agent en- 
l irely shared his view that the revolution would be set in motion 
about 9-22 January and that, even if it did not immediately 

	I ;ike hold of the whole country, it would certainly prevent any 
return to stable conditions from taking place. In 1905 the bour- 
geois parties had supported the revolution and had voluntarily 
paid the wages of the striking workers. Now, however, the bour- 
geoisie was unfavourable to the movement and the revolution- 
ary committee was therefore forced to bear the entire cost.

another interesting telegram: German agent Steinwachs in Jan 1916 talking about propaganda going to Lenin and some rambling pamphlet about a Kerensky government


doc from outside this collection on summary of Hollweg conversation with a general here:

http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=810
	February 1, 1916

	Today General von Falkenhayn explained his view of the situation to me as follows:

	1) Russia
	Although the internal situation is bad, there is no prospect of a complete collapse in the near future. The army will not be capable of conducting any larger offensive even early in the year. Their worth is indicated by the fact that the Bessarabian army, formed from the best army corps and fully rested, has not been able to accomplish much against the Austrian troops, who are not particularly good. 

	2) France
	Internal conditions and morale in the country are not good. Army is good. Its morale is better than a year ago.

	3) England
	As is shown by the armed services bill, England is determined to fight this war to the bitter end. 


why did he dislike England so much in his writings and speaches? same deal here: http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/bethmannspeech1914.htm





	The Minister in Copenhagen to the Foreign Ministry 

	March 1917, 12.55 P- m - 

	Received: 21 March, 4.00 p.m. 

	Dr. Helphand, with whom I discussed events in Russia, ex- 
plained that, in his opinion, the conflict was now primarily be- 
tween the moderate liberals and the Socialist wing. He had no 
doubt that the latter would gain the upper hand. However, the 
victory of the Social Democrats in Russia would mean peace. 
The men at present in power apparently wished to continue the 
war, and the leaders of the faction in favour of this policy were 
Miliukov and Guchkov. Both these men would try to delay the 
convening of the Constituent National Assembly, since they knew 
that the moment the National Assembly had any influence, the 
continuation of the war would be out of the question. 

	When I asked him what he considered the attitude of the 
army to be, Dr. Helphand replied that there might well be some 
desire to continue the war among the Officer Corps, and 
especially among the higher-ranking officers, but that the rank 
and file wanted peace, and that it was highly significant that the 
ordinary soldiers, without exception, fraternized with the 
workers. 

	Dr. Helphand believes that as soon as the amnesty for political 
offenders comes into force, there will be an opportunity to work 
effectively against Miliukov and Guchkov through direct con- 
tact with the Socialists.

	Brockdorff-Rantzau 


So their intel from Parvus says provisional government wants to continue the war (and trying to delay the constituent assembly for that purpose), soldiers don't want to continue, and the socialists want peace and are the ones to support.


"there might well be some desire to continue the war among the Officer Corps"

apparently, Germans thought that the amnesty for political prisoners would be their moment to strike.


	...The State Secretary to the Foreign Ministry Liaison Officer 
at General Headquarters 

	Berlin, 23 March 1917 

	The Imperial Minister in Bern has sent the following telegram: 
'Federal Counsellor [Bundesrat] Hoffmann has been told that 
leading Russian revolutionaries here wish to return to Russia 
via Germany as they are afraid to travel via France because of 
the danger from submarines. Please send instructions in case 
applications to this effect should be made to me. Romberg.' 

	Since it is in our interests that the influence of the radical 
wing of the Russian revolutionaries should prevail, it would 
seem to me advisable to allow transit to the revolutionaries 
there. I would therefore support the granting of permission. 
Would Your Excellency please inform the High Command of 
the Army and ask for their opinion in this matter?

	...Captain Hiilsen {Political Section of the General Staff in 
Berlin] to the Foreign Ministry 

	Berlin, 30 March 1917 

	A confidential agent working for us, who spent a few days in 
Switzerland on our behalf and returned here on 29 March 191 7, 
reports the following: 

	'A large number of the Russians living in Switzerland wish to 
return to Russia. In principle, the Entente agrees with this plan, 
but those members of Russian revolutionary parties who favour 
an immediate peace are to be kept out of Russia by English 
pressure. Three such Russian revolutionaries were refused entry 
into France in the last few days, although they had been issued 
with passports by the Russian consulate in Bern. These Russian 
revolutionaries asked me, in confidence, to suggest to the Ger- 
man government that it should help them to reach Russia in 
spite of all this, and they made the following suggestion : 

	It was considered 
advantageous to Germany to bring out the members of Lenin's 
party, the Bolsheviks, who were about forty in number. Among 
them were Lenin and Rjasanov in Bern, and Semjonov, 
Grigoriev, Abranov, Dora Dolin, and Marie Gutstein in 
Zurich. The fact that twenty to thirty so-called 'revolutionary 
patriots' and Mensheviks who were in favour of continuing the 
war would travel through at the same time seemed unimportant, 
as they would get back to Russia in any case, with the aid of the 
Entente.'""

	A decision on this proposal is humbly requested here. 2 Our 
confidential agent is available for co-operation. 

	Hulsen


so some of the Russian revolutionaries said it would be advantageous for Germany to transfer Lenin to Russia. Apparently the Entente was trying to stop this from happening (which would only make Germany want to do it more).

Hadn't they already decided to send them four days earlier?


	The Minister in Copenhagen to the Foreign Ministry 

	2 April, 5.45 a.m. 

	Had detailed discussion with Scavenius about the situation in 
Russia. The Minister rates the political significance of the 
Socialist Skobolev's inflammatory speeches lower than the press 
of the Entente countries might lead one to believe. Nevertheless, 
Scavenius does see in them a sign that the English are also in 
contact with the extremist Socialist circles. 

	In face of the Russian revolution, we can, in my opinion, 
adopt one of two attitudes: 

	Either we are both militarily and economically in a position 
to continue the war effectively until the autumn. In that case it 
is essential that we try now to create the greatest possible degree 
of chaos in Russia. To this end, any patently apparent inter- 
ference in the course of the Russian revolution should be 
avoided. In my opinion, we should, on the other hand, make 
very effort surreptitiously to deepen the differences between the 
moderate and the extremist parties, for it is greatly in our 
interests that the latter should gain the upper hand, since a 
drastic change would then be inevitable and would take forms 
which would necessarily shake the very existence of the Russian 
empire. However, even if the moderate wing should remain in 
power, I could not imagine a transition to normal conditions 
taking place without considerable turmoil. Nevertheless, I think 
that it would be preferable, from our point of view, to back the 
extremist element, as this would be a more thorough way to 
work and would lead more quickly to some conclusion. In all 
probability, we should, in about three months time, be able to 
count on the disintegration having reached the stage where we 
could break the power of the Russians by military action. If we 
were now to launch a premature offensive, we should only give 
all the various centrifugal forces a motive for uniting and even, 
perhaps, lead the army to rally in its fight against Germany. 

	If, on the other hand, we are not in a position to continue the 
war until the end of this year with any likelihood of success, then 
we should try to achieve a rapprochement with the moderate 
parties now in power and to convince them that if they insist 
on continuing the war, they will merely be doing the work of the 
English for them, opening the gates to reaction, and thus 
jeopardizing even such freedom as they have won. As an addi- 
tional argument, it should be pointed out to the Miliukovs and 
the Guchkovs that, in view of the uncertainty of the position 
in Russia, the English might attempt to reach an agreement 
with us, at the expense of the Russians. 

	Brockdorff-Rantzau 


Brockdorff has terrible ideas. Says it would be good to back extremist element to cause chaos if they think they can continue the war, otherwise to sue for peace.

Also said to hold off attacking lest the unite the factions, setting the stage for Kerensky's push.

If they listened to Brockdorff at all, apparently they thought they should continue the war.


2 April 1917 - Rantzau asks the new SoS he should meet Helphand



	The Under State Secretary to the Minister in Bern 

	Berlin, 2 April 191 7 

	According to information received here, it is desirable that tran- 
sit of Russian revolutionaries through Germany take place as 
soon as possible, as the Entente has already begun to work 
against this move in Switzerland. I therefore recommend all 
possible speed in your discussions with representatives of the 
committee. „ 

	BUSSGHE 


apparently, Entente trying to stop Lenin from getting to Russia helped motivate Germany to send him over.


	The Minister in Bern to the Foreign Ministry 

	4 April, 7.20 p.m. 

	Platten, the secretary of the Social Democratic party, came to 
see me on behalf of a group of Russian Socialists and, more 
particularly, of their leaders, Lenin and Zinoviev, to voice a 
request that a number of the most important emigres, twenty to 
sixty at the most, be allowed to travel through Germany im- 
mediately. Platten states that matters in Russia are taking a 
turn dangerous to the cause of peace, and that everything 
possible should be done to get the Socialist leaders here to 
Russia as soon as possible, as they have considerable influence 
there. Unfortunately, he said, many of the emigres had no identity 
documents and, except for Lenin and Zinoviev, they were very 
anxious that their names should not be mentioned at all. Apart 
from this, they were prepared to submit to any conditions, such 
as travelling through without any stops and in sealed or even 
shuttered compartments. However, they did insist that none of 
them be left behind, that their carriage be assured extra- 
territorial rights, and that each of them be accepted regardless 
of his position for or against continuation of the war. For their 
part, they promised to make efforts in Russia to secure the re- 
lease of a number of German prisoners. Platten, who wants to 
travel to Stockholm to set up an information service, would join 
up with the emigres and would be prepared personally to 
guarantee each one of those travelling and to provide them with 
an authorization from [one word garbled]. This authorization 
should, if possible, contain no names. Platten could take the 
emigres to the frontier together with a German official, and 
could take them through the frontier post one by one. 

	Since their immediate departure would be greatly in our 
interests, I urgently recommend that permission should be 
granted at once, accepting the conditions laid down. Taking 
into account the suspicious nature of the Russians, who would 
not at first believe in the possibility of safe transit, together with 
the ruthless counter-activities of the Entente and the differences 
of opinion among the emigres themselves, there would otherwise 
be a considerable danger of their allowing their decision to be 
altered again. If we show them unreserved confidence, we shall 
put them into a friendly frame of mind. I would consider it 
especially helpful that we should show our confidence in the 
Swiss Socialists by accepting their guarantee as a sufficient one. 
This would place us high in their estimation and would, I hope, 
enable us to establish a permanent relationship which would 
be extremely useful for maintaining connexions with Russia. 
Platten admits himself that there are two sides to the question 
of the justification and the logic of the conditions laid down by 
the emigres for their journey. He said that they believed that they 
had, in this way, insured themselves against being com- 
promised in Russia, and that, after laboriously reaching agree- 
ment, one should not reopen any discussion. Their departure 
should take place not later than Friday. Finally, Platten regards 
it as quite impracticable to consider the possibility of so-called 
Social Patriots, i.e. opponents of peace, presenting^ themselves 
for the journey. Please telegraph at least provisional instructions 
as to whether or not the Russians should hold themselves in 
readiness for Friday. Romberg 


Lenin has demands, wants a sealed car, travel immediately, and for some pro-war exiles to go too. Minister in Bern thinks their passage is important to their interests and urges foreign ministry to accept. Cites "ruthless counter-activites of the Entente"


	The Minister in Bern to the Foreign Ministry 
	6 April, 10.25 P- m - 

	In reply to telegram No. 394. 1 

	Platten reports about twenty members of Lenin's party ready 

	to leave. 

	However, it is still possible that important Social Revolution- 
aries (the party of Weiss) 2 may join them. As yet, however, 
agreement with them has not been possible, and it is very doubt- 
ful whether the discussions with them can be finished in time. 
There is therefore an urgent desire that the journey be post- 
poned until Sunday night, as great value should be laid on the 
participation of the Social Revolutionaries because of the im- 
portant role that they played in the outbreak of the revolution. 
The simultaneous appearance of the leaders of both parties in 
Russia would make a deep impression and would considerably 
further active work for peace. I therefore urgently recommend 
that this wish be fulfilled and the journey be postponed until 
Sunday night.

the secrecy surrounding the whole thing (and German support for Bolsheviks) probably didn't help. For some "bourgeois," seems pretty clear that they regarded Bolsheviks as little more than a foreign plot. An invitation to attack them.

In Radek's contribution to Platten's pamphlet Die Reise Lenins durch Deutschland 
(Berlin, 1924), p. 66, Radek wrote: 'In Stockholm Parvus tried to see Lenin in the 
name of the Central Committee of the German Social Democrats; Ilyich not only 
refused to see him, but asked me, Vorovski and Hanecki, together with Swedish 
comrades, to record this attempt.' Radek and Hanecki were the two closest con- 
tacts of Helphand's among the Bolsheviks. 


Parvus asked to meet Lenin along the way, Lenin refuses him and asks for attempt to be recorded. Perhaps a way for Lenin to shake off accusations of being a German spy.

By some indications, issue of Lenin being a German spy appears to have been divisive. Kerensky and his backers, army officers, those who hated Lenin attached themselves to this idea, those who followed him dismissed it.

Army officers, intel people, officials would in particular have more reason to suspect Lenin of being a German agent.

visited the carriage here while it was in transit. He stated that

only wanted little. In Berlin, milk had been made available for

	15 April, 4.46 a.m. 

	The Socialist National Counsellor Grimm has asked Federal 
Counsellor Hoffmann for his help in getting permission to travel 
to Stockholm and back. From Stockholm, he might possibly 
travel on to Petrograd. Grimm believes that his presence is 
necessary to counteract Branting's activities against peace, that 
it is essential that the opportunity to conclude a separate peace 
be exploited, and that general peace would then follow. 
Although Hoffmann is a personal opponent of Grimm, of whose 
character he has a poor opinion, Hoffmann is inclined to recom- 
mend that permission be granted. Although it is well known that 
Grimm has bitterly attacked us, he has nevertheless stood 
resolutely in opposition to war; he played a leading part at 
Zimmerwald and at Kiental, and has close connexions with the 
extreme left in Russia and France and with the Liebknecht 
group. As far as his work for peace is concerned, Hoffmann 
considers him to be absolutely honest, and says that he is work- 
ing to secure for the Proletariat the credit for having restored 
peace to the world.


irony


seems some thought that the revolutionaries would work for peace, and that was their intention.


	...Grimm made the same request to me personally today, ex- 
pressing himself extremely intelligently. 

	He would like to achieve the following in Petrograd : 

	1 . Procure permission, either official or at least from the Com- 
mittee, for the Russian emigres in Switzerland, especially the 
Social Revolutionaries, who would have great influence on the 
peasants, to return to Russia through Germany. Without a 
cover of this kind, they do not dare to make the journey. 

	2. Sound out the possibilities of peace, and,_ if possible, give 
us his impressions through the Swiss Legation in Moscow. 


they want peace and apparently want to achieve it through influencing the peasants


	...He further believed that an official German counter- announcement should 
be made to the Lvov manifesto, announcing our renunciation of 
annexations and war reparations, in order to strengthen the 
peace party in Russia. I would add here that the Russian 
revolutionaries have warned us against making any announce- 
ment which could give the impression that we are gambling on 
the revolution resulting in Russian military disorganization. 
Thus, they say, the publication of the Kaiser's congratulations 
to Stochod, Field-Marshal Hindenburg's alleged statements 
that the revolution was serving his own ends, and statements in 
the press such as Reventlow's article in the Deutsche Tages- 
zeitung of 12 April have all done incalculable damage. 


Did they have a problem with a "peace party" and "war party" in Russia?

Were they gambling on the revolution resulting in Russian military disorganization? apparently Hindenburg, the Kaiser, and Reventlow thought so. Revolutionaries told them not to make that impression.


	Both Hoffmann and President Schulthess appear to be parti- 
cularly nervous as a result of the American declaration of war, 
and they seem worried that the opportunity of making peace 
with the Russians might not be exploited. They suggest that we 
might perhaps renounce annexations in the East and satisfy 
ourselves with the creation of frontier states with guaranteed 
autonomy.


Some in Germany suggest renouncing annexations and having independent "buffer states" to increase chances of peace after American intervention.


	In these circumstances, I feel that I should recom- 
mend that Grimm both be given permission to make and 
actually make his journey, even if our Socialists should express 
opposition. Since Grimm successfully organized the journey of 
Lenin and his comrades, which was of great value to us,


journy of Lenin "of great value" to them


	and since he has also lately been maintaining the attitude we would 
have him maintain in the Tagwacht and the Swiss National 
Council, it would be hard to understand if we were to try to 
prevent him from making this journey. As he is very ambitious, 
he would take it as a grave insult and would be in a position to 
do us a great deal of damage through his connexions with the 
revolutionary camp in every country. He asks for an assurance 
that he will be allowed to travel both ways unobstructed, taking 
a number of proclamation and other publications with him. 
I feel that we should allow him to enjoy the same treatment as 
the emigres from Brussels. He can do no damage on the military 
side, and he may be decidedly useful politically. What is certain 
is that the Russian revolutionaries will listen to Grimm, a Swiss 
whom, as one of the men of Zimmerwald, they like and trust, 
rather than to German Socialists, especially those of Scheide- 
mann's group. 

	I request a decision as soon as possible. _. 

	Romberg 


so they wanted to send this Grimm guy because they thought it would get them clout with the socialists


in followup Zimmeran quickly accepts, wants to give him passage both ways.


then Zimmerman says Cheidemann and Ebert gave warnings that Grimm was "pro-Entente" and should not be given passage. Minister in Bern says he and Federal Consellor think it was a good idea and it is too late. Says its all good because Grimm wants a separate peace with Russia.

Say Scheidemann and Ebert hold a grudge and/are are opposed for politically motivated reasons. Says:


	In my opinion, it is now our business to stir 
up Russian [one word garbled] with all available means, and, to 
do so, we should not reject the co-operation even of a man like 
Grimm, whatever his motives or views may be. 


sounds like this guy of the mind of stirring up trouble in Russia

	High Command of the Army has following message for Political 
Section of General Staff in Berlin: 

	'Steinwachs sent following telegram from Stockholm on 
	17 April 1917: 

	' "Lenin's entry into Russia successful. He is working exactly 
as we would wish. Hence cries of fury of Entente Social Demo- 
crats in Stockholm. Platten was turned back by the English at 
frontier, a fact which has aroused considerable attention here." 


General staff seem to think Lenin doing their work for them.

Apparently, wanted a military advantage out of Lenin's work.


	...The Minister in Bern to the Foreign Ministry 

	27 April, 1.47 p.m. 

	The secretariat of the organizing committee of the Russian 
revolutionary emigres in Zurich has asked me, through the inter- 
mediary of a reliable Swiss Social Democrat, to get permission 
for its five members, Martov, Martin [one syllable garbled], Axel- 
rod, Semkovski, and Astrov, together with their associates, to 
travel through Germany to Sweden immediately, under the 
same conditions as Lenin's group.


Romberg really gung-ho on sending more revolutionaries, Lenin, Grim, and now these guys. Always wants to send them ASAP


	The Minister in Bern to the Chancellor 

	 April 191 7 

	Platten, who had accompanied the Russian revolutionary Lenin 
and his followers on their journey through Germany, visited 
me today to thank me on their behalf for services rendered. 
Unfortunately Platten was prevented from accompanying his 
fellow travellers to Russia. He was stopped at the frontier by an 
English officer, who cancelled his entry permit. 

	Lenin, on the other hand, received a splendid welcome from 
his followers. It can be said that three-quarters of Petrograd 
workers are behind him. The propaganda among the soldiers is 
more difficult ; the opinion seems to be widespread among them 
that we are going to attack them.


Romberg, Bethmann-Hollweg appear to be interested in "propaganda among soldiers." Romberg says it is more difficult because of "widespread opinion" Germany will attack them.

Also seems true a German offensive would be against Bolshevik interests, while a Kerensky offensive was very much in their interests.


	It is not clear yet which 
	course the revolution will take. Perhaps it will be enough to 
substitute several members of the Provisional Government, like 
Miliukov and Guchkov, by socialists. In any case it would be 
absolutely necessary to increase the number of the partisans of 
peace by an influx from abroad. It is therefore recommended 
that those emigrants who are prepared to leave should receive 
the same facilities as Lenin and his comrades. The greatest speed 
is recommended, as it is to be feared that the Entente will exercise 
pressure on the Swiss government to prevent their departure. 


thinking about overthrowing government with socialists, sending in "partisans of peace" to get a separate peace (or propagandize soldiers?). Basically saying this is working and we should do more. Germans apparently to become Bolshevik Taxi agency.


	Platten said there were a number of Russian revolutionaries 
in Germany whose dispatch to Russia he recommended. From 
Platten's remarks it became clear that the emigrants lack the 
means for the conduct of their propaganda, while the means of 
their enemies are unlimited. The funds collected for them 
went mainly to the Social Patriots. I shall have an agent in- 
vestigate the delicate question of whether it may be possible to 
let them have such means without offending them. In the mean- 
time I would be grateful for telegraphic information about 
whether the revolutionaries are being supported in any other way

'* Romberg 

	1 Marginal note by Pourtales: 'I have spoken to Romberg. With that, the last 
sentence of his dispatch was settled.' 


Romberg in message to Hollweg wants to support revolutionaries with more money. Apparently, Hollweg is in on plans to support Bolsheviks and propagandize Russian soldiers.


another chain (54): Zimmermann says to Brockdorff a "wounded and maimed" counter-protest to Lenin in support of troops had 50,000 people. Minister in Stockholm says he and von Heidenstam think it's true:

	Herr von Heidenstam considers that report is very likely 
true, as both the political line Lenin is pursuing and his peace 
propaganda are completely independent, and he is thus now 
in a position of violent opposition to the government. According 
to a report received today from the Telegram Bureau, he has 
been summoned before the Workers' Council for this reason. 

	There have been large demonstrations in favour of peace, led 
by students, in front of Kazan cathedral, at which violent 
speeches were made against England and the United States, and 
more moderate ones against France. The assassination of 
General Katshalinski is considered significant because he was 
a spokesman of the new government. 

	Anarchy is on the increase. Lucius 


Seem to be happy people are getting assassinated and there is violent opposition to government, as well as "violent speaches" against U.S., England, and France. Signed "Anarchy is on the increase. Lucius"


doc 56 says apparently Herr von Bergen has a connection with Lenin's crew.



doc 57 "Herr Baier" wants to fund Bolsheviks and makes it sound like some kind of humanitarian peace effort.

Notable that the idea of "separate peace" vs. "global peace" would make peace harder in on sense--"separate peace" could be seen as a foreign plot, a trick, and so predispose people to be against peace.

	V. I.   Lenin
	War and Revolution
	A LECTURE DELIVERED MAY 14 (27), 1917

	...That is why the question of treaties, such a simple question, is deliberately and disgracefully confused by the whole press. You say that we have a revolutionary government, that there are ministers in that government who are well-nigh socialists Narodniks and Mensheviks. But when they make declarations about peace without annexations, on condition that this term is not defined (because it means taking away German annexations and keeping our own), then we say: Of what value are your “revolutionary” cabinet, your declarations, your statements that you are not out for a war of conquest, if at the same time you tell the army to take the offensive? Don’t you know that we have treaties, that these treaties were concluded by Nicholas the Bloody in the most predatory fashion? You don’t know it? It is pardonable for the workers or peasants not to know that. They did not plunder, they read no clever books. But when   educated Cadets preach this sort of stuff they know perfectly well what these treaties are about. Although they are “secret” treaties, the whole diplomatic press in all countries talks about them, saying: “You’ll get the Straits, you’ll get Armenia, you’ll get Galicia, you’ll get Alsace-Lorraine, you’ll get Trieste, and we’ll make a final carve-up of Persia.” And the German capitalist says: “I’ll seize Egypt, I’ll subjugate the European nations unless you return my colonies to me with interest.” Shares are things that can’t do without interest. That is why the question of treaties, itself a clear, simple question, has touched off such a torrent of barefaced outrageous lies as those that are now pouring from the pages of all the capitalist newspapers. 

	Take today’s paper Dyen. Vodovozov, a man absolutely innocent of Bolshevism, but who is an honest democrat, states in it: I am opposed to secret treaties; let me say this about the treaty with Rumania. There is a secret treaty with Rumania and it says that Rumania will receive a number of foreign peoples if she fights on the side of the Allies. The treaties which the other Allies have are all the same. They wouldn’t have started to subjugate nations if they had not had these treaties. To know their contents you do not have to burrow in special journals. It is sufficient to recollect the basic facts of economic and diplomatic history. For decades Austria has been after the Balkans with an eye to subjugation. And if they have clashed it is because they couldn’t help clashing. That is why, when the masses demand that these treaties should be published, a demand that is growing more insistent every day, ex-Minister Milyukov and the present Minister Tereshchenko (one in a government without socialist ministers, the other in a government with a number of near-socialist ministers) declare that publication of the treaties would mean a break with the Allies.

	Obviously, you can’t publish the treaties because you are all participants in the same gang of robbers.


did Lenin want the Germans to think they could control him?


	The Minister at The Hague to the Chancellor 

	8 May 1917 

	Among the numerous Russians who are at present living in 
Holland — there are about 2,600 civilian refugees and 300 
soldiers from German prisoner-of-war camps in Rotterdam 
alone — there is considerable dissatisfaction with the Russian 
authorities here, and a certain section of these people is in 
sympathy with the Russian revolution. 

	The opportunity has just arisen to make contact with a 
representative of this last section, and, on this occasion, as had 
seemed likely, it appeared that the present situation could 
probably be very profitably exploited for the advancement of 
our political aims. 

	The personality in question is a certain Vladimir Futran. 
This man would appear to have escaped from a prisoner-of-war 
camp at Doberitz. He is a revolutionary of Lenin's group, and, 
although he has had no very complete education, is an intelli- 
gent man.

	Whether or not, or to what extent his revolutionary opinions 
are genuine, what motives underlie his action, and how far he 
is governed by self-seeking and material aims, it is of course 
impossible to say so soon. On the whole, he gives the impression 
of being a political fanatic with a desire to avenge some in- 
justice suffered by himself or his class. 


so Hollweg interested in "exploiting" Russian revolution and "Lenin's group" "for the advancement of our political aims."


	...The 'Russian Peace League' could be made to serve as a 
starting-point for agitation among the Russian prisoners of war 
in Germany and Austria. Agitation of this nature could be so 
directed as to help those elements in Russia which appear useful 
to us at the moment, for example Lenin's group


Apparently want to help "Lenin's group," and Minister at the Hauge proposes supporting Bolshevik fronts in Holland and propagandizing Russian prisoners of war in Germany for this purpose. Asks for "funds" for the "agitation."


doc 61 29 May 1917


Apparently Zimmerman had hopes for Kerensky to conclude a separate peace, but believes this was sabotaged by French and English influence. Some say their contacts in Russia should be given a time limit to secure a separate peace before advancing, although Zimmerman says this would be a mistake and wants to hold out longer lest he fractured Russians be united.


	The State Secretary to the Minister in Bern 

	3 June 191 7 

	Secret reports show that the governments of the Entente coun- 
tries continue to show great anxiety about Russia. The spread 
of the idea of peace has not been stopped even by the latest — 
and only temporary — consolidation of the provisional govern- 
ment. The despairing advances of the Russian troops cannot 
dissimulate the growing disorganization and unwillingness to 
fight of the Russian army. Lenin's peace propaganda is growing 
steadily stronger, and his newspaper Pravda already prints 
300,000 copies. Work in the armament factories is either at a 
standstill, or has sunk to very low production figures. The trans- 
port crisis continues to grow more acute and, as a result, the 
supply of food to the towns and the army is suffering. There is 
therefore absolutely no possibility of the Entente receiving help 
from that quarter. „

	The Counsellor of Legation in Stockholm to the Chancellor 

	11 July 1917

[july days 16-20 July in Gregorian Calendar]

	No. 7 of the Russische Korrespondenz Prawda 1 reports that no 
agreement was reached in the negotiations between the Russian 
Bolsheviks Ganecki, Vorovski, and Radek, and the German 
Social Democrats Haase, Ledebour, and Herzfeld. The Bol- 
sheviks, who reject any suggestion of working with the 'Social 
Patriots', are shocked by the fact that the German left-wing 
Socialists should want to negotiate with the pro-Entente 'Social 
Patriots'. On this point, the newspaper makes the following 
comment : 

	'The participation of the German Social Patriots in this 
"Work for Peace" is, of course, very distasteful to them, but, 
in order to have the pleasure of meeting the fathers of the 
Russian offensive, they are prepared — under protest, of course 
— to accept even this misfortune. The Russian Workers would 
like to know what attitude the Spartacus group takes to this 
decision made by the Independents.' 

	According to reports from Petrograd in the newspapers here, 
and according to other sources, the influence of Lenin's group 
has unfortunately lessened. In a decision concerning a vote of 
confidence in the provisional government — a decision more or 
less bringing to an end the deliberations of the Workers' and 
Soldiers' Council — the Bolsheviks, reinforced by the inter- 
nationalist Social Democrats and the Ukrainians, only raised 
126 votes, while the majority was able to dispose of 543 votes. 
The waning of the Bolsheviks' influence must be seen as the 
result, partly of the offensive, and partly of the inordinate de- 
mands made by Lenin's group. These demands, of which the 
most extreme is the expropriation of the big capitalist concerns 
(especially of all banks and all the larger industrial and com- 
mercial undertakings) and the big landowners, aim at the 
detachment of all the various individual peoples from Russia 
and their formation into separate republics. It must be added, 
however, that, on the Ukrainian question, the Bolsheviks have 
somewhat changed their position, and that they now only de- 
mand a strong degree of autonomy for the Ukrainians, not their 
total detachment. Pravda for 28 June writes: 

	'The failure of the politics of the provisional government and 
its coalition cabinet grows more apparent from day to day. The 
"Universal Act" published by the Ukrainian Central Council 
and accepted by the All-Ukrainian Soldiers' Congress on 1 1 
June 4 is documentary evidence of this failure. 

	"This act says: "The Ukrainian people should have the right 
to dispose of its own life in its own land, without detaching itself 
from Russia and without breaking away from the Russian state. 
Only our Ukrainian assembly has the right to promulgate laws 
guaranteeing order here in the Ukraine; laws concerned with 
the maintenance of order within the whole of the Russian state 
should be passed by the All-Russian Parliament." ' 

	These are perfectly explicit words. They say, with all possible 
clarity, that the Ukrainian people does not at present wish to 
separate from Russia. It demands autonomy, but does not in 
any way dispute the necessity for or the sovereignty of the 'All- 
Russian Parliament'. 

	A remarkable thing is that the Petrograd Cossacks' Council 
has declared itself against the detachment of the Ukraine. 
Although the majority of Cossacks come from the Ukraine, and 
although they have always attached importance to a certain 
degree of autonomy, they nevertheless feel that they are 
historically an inseparable part of the whole Russian army. 
Moreover, they played such a decisive and, to them, glorious 
role in crushing the liberal and democratic elements in all earlier 
attempted revolutions, that one could hardly expect thern to 
show genuine sympathy for the parties whose aim is to divide 
up Greater Russia. 

	I have the honour humbly to enclose a violent attack against 
the offensive from the Helsinki newspaper Volna, which accom- 
panied the Korrespondez Prawda. Stobbe 

	1 Die russische Korrespondenz Prawda, was edited in German by Hanecki in 
Stockholm.


Did Hollweg tell people he thought Lenin would split Russia into smaller countries? author of letter says the purpose of Lenin's liquidating banks and such is to split Russia into separate countries. "These demands, of which the 
most extreme is the expropriation of the big capitalist concerns 
(especially of all banks and all the larger industrial and com- 
mercial undertakings) and the big landowners, aim at the 
detachment of all the various individual peoples from Russia 
and their formation into separate republics."

Hints at bigger hopes for Lenin, and very unrealistic ones. Author seems to be dismayed that Bolsheviks changed their tune on Ukraine independence.

Seem to be concerned with Lenin's influence lessening.

If this is what they expected from Lenin, small wonder they pushed for concessions at Brest-Litovsk.


===========

after this point, Hollweg no longer Chancellor of Germany--office ended 13 July 1917

http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/german-chancellor-theobald-von-bethmann-hollweg-resigns
	The chancellor owed his final downfall, however, to his failure to manage the civil unrest within Germany, reflected in the feuding Reichstag. During the summer of 1917, as parliamentary debate raged over a proposed peace resolution, Bethmann Hollweg found himself unable to continue to balance the feuding elements of the German government, especially the majority Socialist Party—which was itself alienating its most radical leftist elements by aligning with a center-left coalition—and the conservative right, which predictably enjoyed the support of Hindenburg and Ludendorff. Having previously committed—reluctantly—to an unrestricted naval policy that had led the United States to declare war on Germany the previous April, Bethmann Hollweg was seen by the center-left, the authors of the Reichstag peace resolution, as a warmonger and by the right as a weakling for supporting the efforts to broker a peace.

	Exhausted, Bethmann Hollweg rose in the Reichstag on July 9 to respond to his critics: “My position does not matter…I myself am convinced of my own limitations…I am considered weak because I seek to end the war. A leading statesman can receive support neither from the Left nor the Right in Germany.” The following day, he resigned as chancellor.

weird

others say Reichstag peace resolution had something to do with his downfall



after this, Georg Michaelis became Chancellor


according to Wikipedia: "[Michaelis] remained in this position until 1 November 1917, when he was forced to resign after coming under fire for refusing to commit himself by endorsing a resolution passed by the Reichstag favouring peace without annexation or indemnities."

	Memorandum for the State Secretary 

	Berlin, 17 July 1917 

	Dr. Helphand, who has returned from Stockholm, had a favour- 
able impression of his various discussions with the Russian 
revolutionaries. He said that the influence of Lenin, and of the 
other groups working for a general peace, was continuing to 
grow, in spite of all the claims to the contrary made in the press 
of the Entente countries.

Parvus tells them Lenin influence only growing after July 16 (July Day Jul 16-Jul 20). Says don't believe the "Entente" media.


	The offensive had only taken place 
because the Americans and the English had made it a con- 
dition for the supply of money and raw materials, especially of 
cotton.


Says Americans and English strong-armed Kerensky into the push (If true would mean Americans and English bear major responsibility in installing Lenin)


	The soldiers had only been won over to making the 
offensive by being told that they could see for themselves that 
the negotiations made since the outbreak of the revolution had 
not succeeded in bringing peace, whereas a successful offensive 
would lead quickly and surely to this result. Disappointment 
had already set in, and would result in a further softening-up 
of the army.


refers to negotiations (which ones?), said soldiers were told negotiations weren't working for peace, so a push would bring Germany to table.

presumably, the Germans would be more reluctant to reach an agreement for peace if they believed they had an ace up their sleeve with Lenin (esp. with respect to propagandizing army). Additionally, if they believed Lenin had a chance, would prefer to try to install him and negotiate with him over Kerensky for better terms.


	 This had already reached such a degree, even 
before the offensive, that the army, through the person of 
Brusilov, had said that the collapse of the armed forces could 
only be prevented by an immediate offensive.


apparently command of Russian army (Brusilov?) somehow reached conclusion that a push would be the only way to prevent collapse of armed forces.

IIRC Denekin called for deep withdrawal and repair of morale of armed forces. Time to re-organize "democratization" of army was needed, and an inadverdant "advantage" of such a plan would be they Russian army would be fighting defensively, for their homeland, and so would have more much-needed morale.

However the Russian army reached the conclusion that was the complete opposite of every indication and common sense.


	...Helphand also told me, after asking me to treat this in- 
formation with the utmost confidence, that the Russians were 
not going to allow any discussion of the question of war-guilt 
at the congress which is beginning in Stockholm in the middle 
of August. They did not want to quarrel, but to do useful work 
for the preparation of peace. Similarly, they were not going to 
let themselves be drawn into any consideration of French wishes 
concerning Alsace-Lorraine, and they were hopeful that this 
question, too, might be got round. For the moment, however, 
care must be exercised to prevent the English from getting wind 
of the matter prematurely and thwarting the attendance of the 
French. 


Parvus and Zimmermann apparently interested in Stockholm conference. IIRC a lot of countries barred people from attending. Parvus appears to be spreading rumors about it. 


	The Chancellor to the Foreign Ministry Liaison Officer 
at General Headquarters 

	Berlin, 26 July 191 7 

	Withreference to telegram No. 52751 from Operational Depart- 
ment to Lieutenant-Colonel von Haeften, I request that General 
Ludendorff be told the following: Compliance with secret 
Order I a 4000 given to Eastern Command and Army Group 
Mackensen would mean a new offer of peace to Russia, or would 
at least be interpreted as such by Russian press and public 
opinion in Russia. I do not consider present moment suitable 
for such a step. If our counter-offensive is strong enough to make 
those now in power in Russia fear its continuation, then they, 
or in the event of their removal, their successors, will try to make 
contact with us of their own accord.


Michaelis says to wait for more favorable circumstances for peace, push and make them ask for it, or wait for Lenin. Apparently subscribing to the idea that their efforts with Bolsheviks would come to fruition and give them better terms.

This comes around the beginning of German counter-offensive, after July days.


	If it is not strong enough, 
then these steps, which, in addition bear the stamp of extreme 
haste, will only have harmful effects. I should therefore be very 
grateful if the intended statement could be temporarily shelved, 
and if General Ludendorff could give me an opportunity to ex- 
press an opinion before he formulates new principles for propa- 
ganda at the front. We must be very careful that the literature 
with which we are aiming to further the process of disintegration 
inside Russia does not achieve the directly opposite result. 1 This 
is especially true of the furtherance of separatist tendencies, 
which are falling into disrepute. For example, the Ukrainians 
still reject the idea of total secession from Russia. Any open 
intervention on our part in favour of an independent Ukrainian 
state would undoubtedly be exploited by the enemy in order to 
denounce the existing nationalist currents as German creations.


Said they should increase "separatists tendencies" and "disintegrate" Russia. Talks about how they might be able to get Ukraine. Maybe seeds of the idea of Brest-Litovsk here. Might figure mines in Ukraine would help their war-effort in the West.


	Michaelis 

	1 E. Vandervelde, who spent two weeks touring the Eastern front in June 1917, 
wrote in his Three Aspects of Russian Revolution (London, 1918, p. 134) : 'It seems that 
this propaganda, while admirably organized and splendidly carried on has the 
same fault that we find in all German enterprises of this sort; it over-reaches its 
mark, and provokes finally, by its ponderous insistence, a psychological reaction 
which is the one result that its organizers failed to foresee.' Vandervelde also noticed 
the similarity between German propaganda and the views of the Bolsheviks, the 
Mensheviks, and the Internationalists (p. 133). Bruce Lockhart wrote in The Two 
Revolutions (London, 1957, p. 93) : '. . . most of the Bolshevik propaganda, including  Lenin's articles, which reached the Russian front was disseminated by the Germans, 
who, either with or without the connivance of Lenin, were able to buy the Bolshevik 
newspapers in Stockholm and reproduce them.' 


So Germans would take Bolshevik newspapers, reproduce them and print them on their own. Then give to Russian soldiers, who Lenin had ordered to distribute propaganda to the peasants.


one aside: the Tsar must have been intercepting all of these if Okhrana involved. Wouldn't be very hard to convince Tsar, royalty, top "bourgeois" officials that Lenin was a German agent. Things were set up so that would be easy if they wanted to do so.

The perception of Lenin as a German agent could be of great importance for events in WW1 and subsequent events. Did any of the Bolsheviks themselves suspect him? Intercepts from German communications like these would certainly bolster such a case. What did Stalin think, or profess to think? Did the idea that Lenin was a German agent have any bearing on his death?

Did they think of him as a German agent?


	The State Secretary to the Foreign Ministry Liaison Officer 
at General Headquarters 

	 29 September 1917 

	For the information of the High Command of the Army. 

	The military operations on the Eastern front, which were pre- 
pared on a large scale and have been carried out with great suc- 
cess, were seconded by intensive undermining activities inside 
Russia on the part of the Foreign Ministry. Our first interest, in 
these activities, was to further nationalist and separatist en- 
deavours as far as possible and to give strong support to the 
revolutionary elements. We have now been engaged in these 
activities for some time, and in complete agreement with the 
Political Section of the General Staff in Berlin (Capt. von 
Hiilsen). Our work together has shown tangible results. The 
Bolshevik movement could never have attained the scale or the 
influence which it has today without our continual support. 
There is every indication that the movement will continue to 
grow, and the same is true also of the Finnish and Ukrainian 
independence movements. 


did they really think it was all them?


	According to the most recent reports received here, the situa- 
tion in Russia is that the country, whose economic life has been 
shattered, and which is only just being held together by English 
agents, could be expected to collapse as a result of any further, 
fairly powerful shock.


were they happy about this?

	
	...The preparations for the Finnish rising are, as the High Com- 
mand of the Army knows, busily under way and are being sup- 
ported to a considerable extent. However, it is unlikely that they 
can be maintained right through the winter if the Finnish hopes 
in us are disappointed this autumn and the country is made de- 
pendent on Russia by the food shortage which must be expected 
in the spring. On the other hand, in face of the weakness of the 
Russians, we could expect the Finnish rising to break out now 
and to reach a successful conclusion if we were to preserve 
Finnish confidence in us — a feeling very much in our interests — ■ 
by occupying the Aaland Isles, which dominate the Gulf of 
Bothnia, and by forcing the Russian Army Command to with- 
draw some of the troops stationed in Finnland, by putting pres- 
sure on them at the front. 


apparently had idea that weakening Russia would give them opportunities to grab colonies of Russian empire


	...In the second telegram, No. 1493 of 6 October 
(AS 3761), Ludendorff acknowledges the undermining activities in Russia of the 
Foreign Ministry and of the Political Section of the Deputy General Staff, expresses 
thanks for the allocation of large amounts of money for it, and stresses the value 
of this work, especially in Finland. He shares the view that the occupation of the 
Aaland Islands would be of great political value to Germany, but could be accom- 
plished only if the German lines of communication could run across Sweden. 


Ludendorff credits Foreign Ministry with subversion operations in Russia

Seems like there was an understanding that Chancellor (at this point Michaelis) and the foreign ministry were in charge of this--Michaelis felt fine with directing Ludendorff not to engage in certain propaganda operations. Appearence is that Ludendorff is involved but had not taken charge of these.


===========

From this point,  Georg von Hertling was Channellor (1 November 1917 – 30 September 1918)

supported Hollweg and was "seen as puppet of Ludendorff"

===========


notes on doc 72 are interesting

says that day after October revolution, Parvus acted shady and lost German trust.

also says Parvus' plan for a Socialist conference in Stockholm was "aimed at by-passing the Imperial German government" which one could think would weaken it and contribute to its overthrow (not sure exactly how)

posits that Parvus hoped for a socialist revolution in Germany, and was encouraged by the success in Russia.

an aside: wouldn't this be predictable? from the beginning German Foreign Ministry wonders about motivations of their socialist "agents." But reading what they say and do makes it clear: they want to spread socialism around the world. Lenin himself promised a socialist revolution in Germany, and apparently some in German foreign ministry had the idea of even funding socialist propaganda within their borders.

That the socialists would turn around and spread socialism in Germany (and apparently were for a long time) would be obvious to anyone. It was what they said they would do.

The success in Russia was said to have inspired socialists that socialism could spread to other countries. Hollweg's assurance that this wouldn't happen in Germany is a strange one.


=============

after this, Georg Graf von Hertling was Chancellor (from 1 November 1917 - 30 September 1918)

=============


Doc 73 (8 November 1917) Lucius urges Foreign Ministry not to push for peace, don't want to look weak (due to English), wait to see if Bolsheviks victory certain.


Apparently subscribe to idea that Bolsheviks would give them better terms, seem to be very interested in general in getting favorable terms from the peace (apparently nobody believes in "peace without indemnities or annexations")

Doc 74, others--they didn't talk much about a cease-fire until after Bolsheviks installed.


Doc 75--Ludendorff says Bolsheviks winning is "desirable from our point of view." Wants to exploit for propaganda purposes.


	The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister to the Chancellor 

	Vienna, 10 November 1917 

	Your Excellency, 

	The revolution in Petrograd, which has at least temporarily 
placed the power into the hands of Lenin and his followers, has 
come sooner than we had thought possible.


how long where they planning on fighting the war and subverting Russia? apparently had plans to break up Russia, so something more long-term in getting colonies.


	Whether or not the 
Maximalists will be in a position to establish themselves and to 
exercise governmental power for any length of time, even on the 
scale on which this was done under Kerenski, will emerge in the 
next few days. However, numerous signs seem to me to indicate 
that this question will be answered in the affirmative. 

	If Lenin and the Bolsheviks should succeed in maintaining 
their power, then they will be forced to carry out with the 
utmost vigour the governmental programme which they have 
formulated. In this context, their promise to bring Russia a 
'democratic peace' will occupy first place, and we therefore seem 
to have reached a decisive turning-point in the peace question. 


clearly saw the opportunity for a separate peace, even before this guy pointed it out


	As I am considerably the younger of the two of us, I am far 
from wishing to take the initiative or to offer suggestions to 
Your Excellency, who has much greater experience on which 
to draw. However, as, after our many discussions about the 
ramifications of the peace question


says "the peace question" something Hertling talks about a lot.


	Whether or not Lenin and his colleagues will have the power 
to maintain their supremacy for any considerable time is probably 
a question which nobody can answer. For this very reason, how- 
ever, it would seem essential to exploit this moment, and to 
offer them all the help that they would need to produce faits 
accomplis in the peace question. If the Leninists were to succeed 
even in bringing about the promised armistice, then, it seems to 
me, we should have won almost a complete victory on the 
Russian sector, for, if it achieved an armistice, the Russian 
army, in its present state, would surely pour back into the hinter- 
land in order to be on the spot when the estates are distributed. 
In the present circumstances, an armistice would make this 
army vanish, not to reappear at the front within the forseeable 
future. 


points out (correctly I think) that if government might be temporary, now is the time for peace. Says that the soldiers would all want to fall back to stop their things from being collectivized anyway (dunno about that analysis...).

one would thin if government were unstable, declaring peace would be the way to bolster it and stabilize it.

in their communications, come off as caring more about imperial ambitions than freeing up troops for war on Western front.


	From what I know of Lenin's ideas and intentions, they are 
directed first of all towards renewing the attempt to achieve 
general peace, and next, if the Western powers would not permit 
the former, towards concluding a separate peace with us. 


so would they decide, if to act as imperialistically as possible, that sabotaging general peace would be the way to go?


	According to reports received from Petrograd, Lenin has already 
approached the Western Powers with a view to obtaining their 
agreement to the conclusion of a general peace, and, according 
to my information, has given them only a short time in which to 
answer his request. If, as we can presume with reasonable cer- 
tainty, the other Entente Powers refuse, then Lenin will be 
faced with the decision to turn his idea of a separate peace with 
the Central Powers into a reality. However, he will only wish to 
do this, or be able to, if we accept the formula, peace 'without 
annexations or reparations'. 

We should certainly be furthering this course of development 
if we were once again to announce to the men in power in 
Russia in some sufficiently friendly way that we still adhere to 
the principles for peace which we have formulated, that is, those 
set out in the peace resolution passed in the Reichstag, in Herr 
von-Kuhlmann's speech, in my various announcements, and in 
our answers to the Pope's peace note. On the basis of such 
declarations by the Central Powers, and after the rejection of a 
general peace without annexations or reparations by the Western 
Powers


interesting--wanted to make an effort for general peace, but assumed that the Western Powers would reject it?


	Lenin could then easily make advances towards a 
separate peace with us within the terms of his programme, and 
could proceed to the conclusion of an armistice. Since the 
Maximalists' programme includes the concession of the right to 
self-determination of the non-Russian peoples of Russia, the 
question of what should finally be done with Congress Poland, 
Courland, Livonia, and Finland could well be left to be decided 
in the course of peace negotiations. It would be our business to 
ensure that the desire for separation from Russia and for political 
and economic dependence on the Central Powers be voiced from 
within these nations. In view of what I have said, I therefore 
believe that we could influence the development of the situation 
in Russia favourably to our aims, if, as soon as possible, we were 
to make declarations to the effect stated and such as would be 
sufficient to enable the Maximalists to enter into direct negotia- 
tions with us without any fears. As far as I am concerned, I 
would consider allowing myself to be interviewed, for the 
reports received from Petrograd offer sufficient grounds for a 
comprehensive answer. 


came off as goal was for Lenin to conclude separate peace and then for them to grab territory from Russian empire (which is what happened)


	In view of our great military successes on the Italian front, 
there is now no reason to fear that a statement in these terms 
could be interpreted as a sign of our weakness : nor can I see that 
any other harmful effects could result from such a step. In 
addition, a further advantage which we should gain from this 
step is that we should take every gust of wind out of the sails of 
our Socialist parties, with whom Lenin is already trying to open 
relations. Lenin's desire to negotiate with the Socialist parties 
of the Central Powers about peace is, in the last analysis, only 
an attempt to kindle the social revolution in the states of the 
Central Powers, as a defence for Russia in place of his now 
almost useless military apparatus. However, if we, as govern- 
ments, take up the basic standpoint of peace without annexa- 
tions or reparations, then the ground will be removed from 
under the feet of this new Socialist conference before it assembles ; 
and it seems to me important that we should make such a meet- 
ing superfluous. 


very interesting. Says another reason to call for peace without annexations or indemneties is to "take wind out of sails" of socialists, which had been previously discussed as dangerous and supported by Lenin.


Is the Austro-Hungaian minister a good guy? seems like he's trying to use Foreign Ministry logic to argue for declaring peace without annexations or indemnities.

comes off as trying to be very polite. Also mentions previous conversations with Hertling in writing.

	
	I should be most obliged to Your Excellency if you would be 
good enough to examine the ideas which I have developed here, 
and to give me your opinion of the matter as soon as possible. In 
my opinion, we should not allow this moment to pass un- 
exploited, nor miss any opportunity of bringing the war in the 
East to an end. For the second time, we are being offered the 
chance of achieving this end by quick action. I doubt whether 
the possibility will arise again in such favourable circumstances. 
I need not enumerate the opportunities, both military and 
political, which will be offered to us, and especially to Germany, 
if we can finish with the Russians now. I would, on the other 
hand, like to emphasize the economic factor, for, after a break 
with the Western Powers, Russia will be forced to rely econo- 
mically on the Central Powers, who will then have the oppor- 
tunity of penetrating and reorganizing Russian economic life. 
The significance of this for the future needs no further comment. 

	Yours, &c, 
	Czernin 


wants him to do it ASAP and talks about how great the future would be if opportunity taken


	P.S. Since I ended this letter, a telegram has arrived from 
Petrograd, containing the basic principles for an offer of peace, 
decided on by the Soviet Congress, and these confirm the accu- 
racy of the idea, which I expressed above, that Lenin's group 
is determined to put its peace programme into effect as quickly 
as possible and that it is, for the moment, still proposing a 
general peace. However, it must be clear to the Maximalists that 
a general peace cannot develop from their suggestions, since 
their ideas are by nature directed more against the Western 
Powers than against us. I therefore think that the premises 
underlying my suggestions have been reinforced by the offer of 
peace made by the Soviet Congress.


points out that general peace can't happen from them since Maximalists are crazy and anti-Western.


	1 This letter was one of two enclosures sent by Herding, the Imperial Chancellor, 
to Kuhlmann on 1 2 November. Herding was in Munich at the time and Czernin's 
letter was handed over to him by Thun, the Austro-Hungarian Minister there. 
Herding expressed his agreement in principle with Czernin's arguments, but re- 
served the right to define his attitude more precisely later. He asked Kuhlmann 
what proposals he had to make. 


apparently this letter was passed around, so people would know that Chancellor knew of this.


https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/peace_initiatives
	Confronted with the British inquiry, Richard von Kühlmann (1873-1948), Germany’s recently installed foreign secretary, decided to act. He did so because of rising peace sentiment in Germany among the liberal and socialist parties; concern that the Austrians, then in the midst of the Armand-Revertera conversations, might pursue a separate peace of their own; and a belief that Britain wanted out of the war, even if it meant making major concessions to the Germans. On 11 September, German leaders agreed marginally to scale back the economic and strategic guarantees they wanted in Belgium, especially by giving up the German navy’s demands for permanent bases along the Flanders coastline. This stance gave Kühlmann something to offer the British; he proceeded to send a version of the new German position to the Spanish minister in Brussels, the Marquis de Villalobar (1864-1926), for transmission to London. Villalobar told his own superiors, who notified the British ambassador in Madrid that high-level German officials were interested in peace communications – a more ambiguous message than Kühlmann intended.


Kullman involved in peace efforts before

as far as I can tell, they never expressed agreement for "peace without annexations or indemnities"


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottokar_Czernin
	At a conference between Germany and Austria-Hungary on 17–18 March 1917 on the goals of the war, he suggested inter alia the cession of territory of the Central Powers to arrange a fast peace with the Entente. In his view, the declaration of war by the United States was a disaster and a victory for the Central Powers became improbable. More precisely, he suggested that Germany should abandon Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium in return for large territorial gains in Poland. In Count von Czernin's scenario Austria-Hungary would be compensated with primarily Romanian territory.


apparently still wasting time with carving up territories at some point.



doc 79 (11 November 5.10 a.m.) Still thinking of a peace deal that's not too harsh. Also something about secret agents in Petrograd.


Doc 81 interesting, says the Bolsheviks have brought instability, says there is a civil war as of 12 Nov 1917


Doc 82

Kuhlmann tells Hertling Count Czernin's bid for peace would make Germany look weak

Kühlmann is the guy involved in weak and ultimately unsuccessful peace efforts earlier (see: https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/peace_initiatives)

according to wikipedia page, he was involved in making Armenian genocide worse

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor#CITEREFCecil1996
	Until the late 1950s, the Kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence. Partly that was a deception by German officials. For example, President Theodore Roosevelt believed the Kaiser was in control of German foreign policy because Hermann Speck von Sternburg, the German ambassador in Washington and a personal friend of Roosevelt, presented to the president messages from Chancellor von Bülow as messages from the Kaiser. Later historians downplayed his role, arguing that senior officials learned to work around him.

http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/paul-von-hindenburg
	Hindenburg participated in the intrigues that led to Bethmann’s dismissal in July 1917 and saw to it that the chancellor’s successors remained no more than figureheads. He accepted the increasingly unrealistic war aims of the militarists and nationalists. The shrewd common sense that had been a hallmark of his earlier career gave way to a passivity ironically replicating that of Wilhelm II.

	...His appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor in January 1933 gave the Nazi regime badly needed legitimacy. It thereby laid the groundwork for the destruction of the Germany Hindenburg loved after his fashion and served according to his best lights.

	Count Czernin (1872-1932), the foreign minister, warned the German statesmen that Austria-Hungary would not be able to survive a fourth war winter. Unless peace was concluded within a few months, a revolution of the people would overthrow the monarchies. Even a bad peace wuld at least ave the social order. CCzernin cautioned the Germans that their own conditions were only slightly etter than those of Austria and that the tide was running against them.

	Yet the Germans considered Czernin a frightened pessimist. Following the line of Ludendorff, Bethmann-Hollweg argued that time was now working for the Central Powers. When Count Czernin came to Germany in May 1917, nobody was willing to discuss with him methods for eaching a negotiated peace. Instead the Germans insited upon a discussion of the future of the Baltic and Balkan countries as well as of Russian Poland. All of them were to remain under the direct or indicrect control of the Central Powers, with Germany claiming the lion's share. Czernin, however, was not interested in annexations but in peace, and he informed Matthias Erzberger (1875-1921), a deputy of the German Reichstag, of his grave worries. Erzberger, a member of the Center party, had originally been a school teacher and represented a district of small peasants in South Wurttemberg. A clever, active, and versatile man, he had gained a reputation and won contacts with the government and with industrialists. During the war he had propagated a program of annexations and agitated for the opening of unrestricted submarine warfare. The government had sent him on occasional missions abroad.

	But Erzberger was too soberly judicious not to recognize the shift in the military balance. In fact, in the summer of 1917 the Supreme Command itself began to indicate that the war could not be ended in 1917 and demanded from the government an intensive preparation of the people for the continuation of the war beyond the coming winter. These impressions changed Erzberger's political outlook, and he decided to act. In the first days of July the Social Democrats had urged the government to grant the equal franchise and make a public declaration on its wilingness to conclude a peace without annexations and contributions. On July 6 Erzberger made a speech in a closed session of the main committee of the Riechstag in which he proved that the assumptions and expectations which had led to the unrestricted submarine warfare were thoroughly mistaken. Although the German submarines had actually sunk more ships than had been considered possible, the Allies had not only British shipping but the whole world tonnage at their disposal. It was clear that the predictions made by the German navy chiefs, that England would be defeated before the harvest, had been utterly erogenous, and it was doubtful whether the submarine war could ever bring decisive results.

	This sharp criticism of the government gave the justification for Erzberger's demand that the Reichstag should assume the leadership in a policy toward peace negotations through a public declaration on Germany's purely defensive war aims. Erzberger succeeded in rallyng the whole Center party into cooperation with the Progressives and Social Democrats for strengthening the position of the German parliament.

	Erich Ludendorff vs. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (July 1917) 

	As chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (1856-1921) was generally a voice of moderation, particularly after Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1936) and Erich Ludendorff (1865-1937) replaced Erich von Falkenhayn at the Supreme Command of the Army in the summer of 1916. Bethmann Hollweg's hopes for Woodrow Wilson's mediation at the end of 1916 came to nothing, and, over the chancellor's objections, Hindenburg and Ludendorff forced the adoption of unrestricted submarine warfare in March 1917. Bethmann Hollweg remained in office until July, when the passage of the famous “Peace Resolution” forced his resignation and replacement by Georg Michaelis (1857-1936). Here, we see Ludendorff helping to force Bethmann’s resignation by appealing to the Kaiser. 

	On the morning of July 6, Erzberger, the busybody member of the Center Party’s parliamentary faction, gave a speech in the Reichstag (Main Committee). He is to my mind a downright despicable product of partisan politics


saying the speech for peace was politically motivated?

	
	but he has been raised to an important position not only by the most narrow-minded of his political friends, but also by the government itself. This speech could hardly be excelled in its cowardly retreat from all trace of energy to continue the war. He put forward a resolution in favor of a peace “without annexations, etc.” News of the resolution immediately got to General Ludendorff. I was at this very moment presenting a report to Ludendorff when Lieutenant Colonel Bauer, who had himself been informed by a member of parliament, dashed into the room. “Now it is high time for the Chancellor to go,” were his closing words.


why did they decide the peace resolution was a "high time" for Hollweg to go?


	In the train to Berlin, there were bright spirits over the prospect of the fight ahead. The plan for the campaign was set. The Chancellor must go, and General Ludendorff is going to give a brilliant speech in parliament, in which he “would expose the complete stupidity, in fact the criminality of this parliamentary cowardice.” [ . . . ]


In any case, Ludendorff planned some kind of campaign to bring down Hollweg


	Things in Berlin, however, proceeded much differently than we had assumed. The [ . . . ] Kaiser went first to Bethmann Hollweg, informed himself there and then gave short shrift to both top generals as soon as they appeared, so we returned dejected to Kreuznach on the evening of July 7.

	The Field Marshall was deeply upset. He naturally found the whole business outrageous, while Ludendorff’s bitterness toward the Chancellor only grew.


So Kaiser gets in touch with Hollweg first, appears to side with him, Hindenberg (?) and Ludendorff upset by this.


	We were thus ordered by the Kaiser to remain in Kreuznach. There the consternation remained great. There was no way things could stay like this. [ . . . ]

	General Ludendorff played his last trump against the Chancellor. He asked to be relieved of his position and – Hindenburg joined him. Whether or not they were serious does not matter. It happened. The Kaiser received news of it by telephone from Kreuznach (July 12). Very angry, he summoned both generals but saw himself compelled by the force of Bethmann Hollweg’s reasoning, to the effect that: “I cannot remain in power if the generals resign.” [ . . . ]


so Ludendorff and Hindenburg threaten to resign if Hollweg not deposed.

Hollweg's own reasoning seems to have aided the Kaiser's decision.

Are these the "famous Lichnowsky telegrams?"


29/7/1914

Lichnowsky sends a telegram summarizing a conversation with Grey saying England can't stay neutral in a conflict between Germany/Austria-Hungary and Russia/France if mediation fails.

Meanwhile, Hollweg implies that Germany plans to invade Belgium.


1/8/1914

Tyrell, Grey's private secretary tells Lichnowsky that if Germany doesn't attack France Britain can remain neutral and guarantee French neutrality. Grey calls him to confirm. Lichnowsky sends this offer to Berlin. Berlin gladly accepts.

They decide to mobilize German armies eastward, and Motlke is unhappy that Schlieffen plan not being followed.

Grey wants to know about Germany's intentions for Belgium warning of "serious consequences" if Berlin doesn't provide assurances.

Later in the evening they get another telegram saying Lichnowsky must have misunderstood Grey's comments and they made no guarantee of French neutrality or offer to stay neutral. Kaiser is furious and orders invasion on the West.


who was right? did Lichnowsky "misunderstand" Grey, or did Grey pull the rug out from under Berlin via Lichnowsky?



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Max,_Prince_Lichnowsky
	Between 23 and 30 July, Sazonov having declared that Russia would not tolerate an attack on Serbia, all attempts to mediate the crisis were rebuffed by Germany. In the meantime, Serbia had replied to the Austrian ultimatum and Berchtold was "content ... with the Serbian reply".

	"On the 30th July, when Berchtold wanted to come to terms, we sent an ultimatum to Petrograd [Russia], merely because of the Russian mobilisation, although Austria was not attacked; and on the 31st July we declared war on Russia, although the Czar pledged his word that he would not order a man to march, as long as negotiations were proceeding – thus deliberately destroying the possibility of a peaceful settlement."

this true?

	...The pamphlet became a formative and primary source in the minds of all the allied politicians who arranged the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919.

interesting that he wanted to blame Germany during the war. Whether he knew it or not he set-up Versaiiles.


not many people refer to "the Lichnowsky telegrams" like Hollweg does. Only thing google finds is this:

https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/wi-july-crisis-made-august-1914-looking-for-advice.385002/page-3



https://archive.org/stream/revelationsofpri00lich/revelationsofpri00lich_djvu.txt
	In trying to explain what prompted Prince 
Lichnowsky to wite his memorandum for 
" the family archives," nearly all the Ger- 
man editors lay great stress upon his alleged 
personal vanity and his resentment at seeing 
his efforts toward strengthening the bonds 
between England and Germany made a grim 
joke by the outbreak of the world war. The 

	Prince is also called a simple-minded person, 
completely taken in by the deceptive courtesy 
of the British diplomats and possessing none 
of the qualifications necessary to make him 
a profitable representative of the Kaiser at 
the Court of St. James's. All through the 
comments, from extreme Pan-German to so- 
cialistic, runs a vein of sarcastic criticism of 
the peculiar " ability " shown by the Ger- 
man Foreign Office in picking its Ambassa- 
dors. 


	All the Pan-German and annexationist 
papers take occasion to link up Prince Lich- 
nowsky with Dr. von Bethmann Hollweg, the 
former Imperial Chancellor, and make the 
latter responsible for the appointment of the 
" pacifist " Prince. In doing this they renew 
all their old charges of weakness and pacif- 
ism against the ex-Chancellor, and intimate 
that he may be the next German formerly 
occupying a high place in the Government to 
write memoranda for his family archives. 
Some of the papers did not wait to write 
regular editorials about the memorandum, 


https://books.google.com/books?id=DBwTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA957&lpg=PA957&dq=%22Prince+Lichnowsky%22+socialism&source=bl&ots=5sqtKrqkc3&sig=aVjUX5W5SoJhMwm9nLjBx5OYgHM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip1IHTytrWAhXGxYMKHapwApg4ChDoAQgxMAU#v=onepage&q=%22Prince%20Lichnowsky%22%20socialism&f=false
	In Lichnowsky's view, Britain would definitely support Russia and France in any war defending Serbia against Austrian aggression. Jagow in particular, however, believed that Lichnowsky had been duped by the British. In August 1914 on the British declaration of war against Germany, Lichnowsky left his post, returned to Germany, and retired from the diplomatic service.

	In a privately circulated pamphlet in 1916, Lichnowsky asserted that his efforts to prevent the outbreak of World War I had not been supported by the German government. This pamphlet, published in January 1918 without his permission and widely distributed by the Allies, caused his expulsion from the Prussian upper house of parliament in April 1918.



Edward Grey is sketchy.

Maybe Lichnowsky was a good guy? or even both could have wanted to start war.

pg 110 of his book:

	We earnestly advocated in Vienna the acceptance of the mediation desired by Grey, and in spite of the strongest pressure had failed.



then he blames England for not curbing Russian mobilization.

	...The various English measures for mediation had always presented the aspect of pressure on Vienna, while pressure on St. Petersburg such as that which we had applied in Vienna was conspicuous by its absence. That is the real reason why our mediation proved in practice to be hopeless.


makes a lot of excuses. All Vienna had to do was not invade, Serbia agreed to most of the demands and the one not accepted could have been better served by international arbitration.


pg 128

	...It would have been a heavy blow to the interests of our ally if we had participated in such an arbitration, as von Jagow rightly termed it, so long as Austria did not itself desire the interference of the Powers in its settlement with Serbia. We should only have been open to reproach if we had refused every offer of mediation. 


some kind of excuse for refusing mediation proposals


taylor book:

	Lichnowsky’s dispatch reached the Wilhelmstrasse at about the same moment as a message from Vienna informing the German government that Austria would declare war on Serbia the next day, or at the latest on July 29. Thereupon Bethmann-Hollweg committed either an incredible blunder, or—as Albertini and some other historians believe—an act of almost equally incredible duplicity. Acting upon instructions from the Kaiser, he forwarded to Vienna Sir Edward Grey’s suggestion about German good offices, but on his own initiative he omitted a key passage in the message he had received from the German Embassy in London which stressed the seriousness of the British warning, and he failed to indicate any official German endorsement of the suggestion; he merely asked for the Austrian views about it. He even allowed his colleague, Jagow, to call in the Austrian Ambassador, and in effect to advise him that the Austrians should pay no attention to any British suggestions that Berlin might feel obliged, for the sake of the record, to forward.


sounds like Hollweg didn't like what Lichnowsky was saying about seriousness of the situation so he deleted that line. Wikipedia cites Fischer but Albertini sounds like a better source. Possibly, Lichnowsky was creating problems for their plans, which could be why press crucified him later.

	The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. Revelation of the contents enraged American public opinion, especially after the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann publicly admitted the telegram was genuine on March 3, and helped generate support for the United States declaration of war on Germany in April.


Arthur Zimmerman not doing Germany any favors


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Zimmermann
	Arthur Zimmermann (5 October 1864 – 6 June 1940) was State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the German Empire from 22 November 1916 until his resignation on 6 August 1917. His name is associated with the Zimmermann Telegram during World War I. However, he was closely involved in plans to support rebellions in Ireland and in India, and to assist the Bolsheviks to undermine Tsarist Russia.


right he shows up in the Bolshevik docs a lot


should look into later


point is it is weird that the same guys who started the war later sabotaged German's war efforts and helped the Bolsheviks.
