	Late in the evening on January 8, Svyatopolk-Mirsky and the Director of the Police Department AA Lopukhin went to Tsarskoe Selo to Nicholas II. The minister acquainted the king with Gapon's letter and a working petition; he described Gapon as a "priest-socialist" and informed the emperor of the measures taken. The king wrote about this in his diary [79] . That same evening Svyatopolk-Mirsky charged the chief of the gendarmes, KN ​​Rydzevsky, to arrest Gapon and to escort him to the Peter and Paul Fortress. However, the police did not dare to fulfill this mandate. According to General A. A. Mosolov , Rydzewski explained this by saying that Gapon "sat down in one of the houses of the working quarter and would have to sacrifice not less than 10 people to the police for the arrest"
