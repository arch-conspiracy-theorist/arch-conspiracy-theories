	Burtsev warmly welcomed the February Revolution. After the July events, he became one of the skirmishers of the anti-Bolshevik campaign. Burtsev wrote about the Bolsheviks: "These are our former comrades. Now they, taking advantage of the critical situation in which the entire country is due to the war, are its enemies and, for the sake of the success of their doctrinaire and their demagoguery, decided to complete their tasks, at least for this it was necessary to stake the fate of the whole country. " He believed that in July, "Lenin and his comrades treated us no less than a good plague or cholera"

	When Kerensky was head of the Revolution, Burtzev led a furious attack against men like Verkhovsky, Kerensky's Minister of War. When Lenin became the leader of the Revolution he led an even more venemous attack against Lenin.

	In Paris, Burtzev, now BLINDED BY RAGE, an open champion of Kolchak and Denekin, assembles the literary material for the assault on Lenin. John Spargo enrolls in the mud-slinging brigade and is dully supplied with FACTS and DOCUMENTS.


Spargo is the guy who laid it on the Bolsheviks here:

Author of introduction some Soviet guy who was in with Lenin during revolution.

Not sure what he is talking about but maybe worth looking into.

Says Malinovsky reported some dirt on Lenin to Beletzky, who told this to Burtsev. Apparently this was published in an article by Spargo.


there is something off about Verkhovsky, according to taylor:

	There may be one man still alive who knows the whole story; the Russian assistant military attaché, Captain Alexander Werchovski, who replaced Artamanov during his absence. A friend of Werchovski, a Polish nobleman named Louis de Trydar-Burzynski, stated in his memoirs, published in Italy in 1926, that “the assassination [at Sarajevo] was perpetrated with the support of the Russian military attaché at Belgrade, Captain Werchovski...” Werchovski, he continued, “was later War Minister in the Kerensky government; he was a young man whom I had known very well for years, and he told me quite frankly the truth about the origins, preparations and execution of the plot.” Unfortunately, Werchovski, if he is living today, is not likely to tell any more about the case; when last heard of, he held a high command in the Red Army—a curious detail in itself.

	...Monday Sth WiwnJ^rf 1917 

	...Dinner with Armand de Saint-Sauveur at Contant’s restaurant. 
He is very worried about die situation- The town is in a fever and 
trouble is expected tonight It is said that General Verkhovsky, who 
has left the War Ministry, is in agreement with the Bolsheviks and 
that he has gone to the Soviet headquarters in the Smolny Institute 
to take charge of the movement against Kerensky.

	Burtsev writes today in his newspaper Obshcheye 
Delo S4 

	“It may now be quite confidently affirmed that there was no 
Kornilov conspiracy! Actually there was something quite differ- 
ent: a compact between the government and General Kornilov to 
fight the Bolsheviks'. That which the government’s representatives 
were negotiating with General Kornilov — a fight against the Bol- 
sheviks — had been the cherished dream of representatives of var- 
ious parties, both democratic and socialist. Right down to that 
unhappy day of August 26, they all looked upon General Kornilov 
as their saviour from the impending Bolshevik menace.” 

	Not a “conspiracy,” but a “compact” — writes Burtsev 
in italics. 

	He is right. In this instance he is undoubtedly right. 
	A compact was concluded to organize a conspiracy 
against the Bolsheviks, that is, against the working 
class, against the revolutionary army and the peasantry. 
It was a compact for a conspiracy against the revolution ! 


Burtsev saying Kornilov working for Kerensky


	...Burtsev said recently in Obshcheye Delo that “there 
was no Kornilov conspiracy ,” that there was “only a 
compact ” between Kornilov and the Kerensky govern- 
ment to wipe out the Bolsheviks and the Soviets with 
a view to establishing a military dictatorship. In con- 
firmation of this, Burtsev publishes in Obshcheye Delo, 
No. 6, an “explanatory memorandum” of Kornilov’s, 
consisting of a number of documents which give the 
history of the conspiracy. The immediate object of Bur- 
tsev’s move is to create a favourable atmosphere for 
Kornilov and to enable him to escape trial. 


Stalin impugning sinister motives on Burtsev


	...We are far from inclined to consider Kornilov’s 
materials exhaustive. Apart from the fact that Korni- 
lov is trying to shield himself from the charge of treason, 
he omits to mention, for example, certain persons and 
organizations implicated in the conspiracy, in the first 
place, representatives of certain Embassies at General 
Headquarters who, on the evidence of witnesses, played 
a by no means secondary role. It should also be 
noted that Kornilov’s “explanatory memorandum” was 
police-edited by Burtsev, who deleted several, and 
probably very important, passages from it. Nevertheless, 
the “memorandum” is of great value as documentary 


Burtsev "police edited" Kornilov's "explanatory memorandum"? what does that mean?


same article:

https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1917/10/04-2.htm
	Who Were They ?

	Who were Kornilov's advisers and inspirers? To whom did he confide his conspiratorial designs in the first place?

	"I wanted," says Kornilov, "to invite M. Rodzyanko, Prince G. Lvov and P. Milyukov to participate in the discussion of the state of the country and the measures needed to save it and the army from complete collapse, and requests were wired to them to be at General Headquarters not later than August 29."

	Those were the principal advisers, on the admission of Kornilov himself.

	Nor is that all. Besides advisers and inspirers, Kornilov had major collaborators, in whom he placed his hopes, on whom he relied, and with whom he intended to carry out his plot.

	Listen to this:

	"A project for the constitution of a 'Council of National Defence' was drawn up, to consist of the Supreme Commander as Chairman and Kerensky as Vice Chairman, Savinkov, General Alexeyev, Admiral Kolchak and Filonenko. This Council of Defence was to exercise a collective dictatorship, since it was recognized that a one-man dictatorship would be undesirable. Other Ministers suggested were Messrs. Takhtamyshev, Tretyakov, Pokrovsky, Ignatyev, Aladin, Plekhanov, Lvov and Zavoiko."

	This was the sinister band of right honourable conspirators who inspired Kornilov and were inspired by him, who secretly confabulated with him behind the backs of the people and applauded him at the Moscow Conference. 


sounds like they wanted to use the affair to get rid of certain people?

Kornilov's insistence on "death penalty" seems to have been of propaganda value to Stalin

	...The Kerensky government not only knew of this diabolical plan, but itself took part in elaborating it, and, together with Kornilov, was preparing to carry it out.


So Stalin, along with Burtsev, says Kerensky was in with the plot for a coup against his government

Stalin makes it sound like a plan involving him to grab dictatorial power.

This doesn't really make sense though since the whole driving force behind the coup was Kerensky horribly mismanaging the army, and Kerensky iirc called on Bolsheviks for aid and armed them.

Did Burtsev, whatever he published, force their hand in going with this "Kerensky was in on it" line of propaganda?


	...The "Kornilov conspiracy" was a conspiracy of the imperialist bourgeoisie against the revolutionary classes of Russia, against the proletariat and the peasantry.

	The aim of the conspiracy was to crush the revolution and establish a dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie.

	There were divergencies among the plotters, but they were of a minor, quantitative order. 


doesn't seem very convincing...

wait actually now that I think about it I guess he was right lol

more on Burtsev and Kornilov affair. Kornilov's expalantion for his actions implicated Kerensky in conspiring to attack Bolsheviks. This was leaked to Burtsev. Kerensky denied the veracity of the leaks.

from Henderson book on Burtsev:

	Burtsev had managed to obtain several excerpts from Kornilov’s own ‘testimony’ written for the benefit of Shablovsky’s commission shortly after his arrest.41 These, he published in The Common Cause under the heading ‘Kornilov’s Explanatory Note’ and, over the next few days, supplemented them with copies of the telegraph exchange which had taken place between Kornilov and Kerensky and other documents of relevance. In so doing he provided the public for the first time with a different explanation of events, showing that the accused had, in fact, acted in full agreement with the government and arguing that there never had been a mutiny or a plot.42 Burtsev demanded that the Premier apologize in person and, judging by the thousands of signatures his newspaper collected in support of his stance, the case he made was a convincing one.

	" Past " - a monthly magazine on the history of the liberation movement in Russia, the first legal journal of such subjects in the country. He went to Petersburg in 1906-1907 and in 1917-1926. The circulation in 1907 is about 30 thousand copies. The journal was published under the editorship of Bogucharsky and Shchegolev with Burtsev's formal participation. The magazine was devoted to the history of the liberation movement in Russia. The journal's materials laid the foundation for the source base for studying the history of the revolutionary and social movement in Russia in the 19th century. Since November 2012, the publication of the continuation of the journal, the leaders Shishkin Vitaly and Vladimir Gryaznov is preparing. The journal will continue to cover revolutionary events in modern Russia.


It's a journal on the history of the revolution by both Shchegolev and Burtsev

	...In 1900-1904 abroad, in London, Paris and Geneva, VL Burtsev and L.E. Shishko were released 6 numbers of the collection "The Past". The materials published in them were devoted to the revolutionary movement of the 1860s and 1880s, and especially to the Narodnaya Volya . Much of the material was a reprint of old illegal literature, but there were also unreleased material, memories. After Burtsev returned to Russia in the autumn of 1905 and after an amnesty in January 1906, together with V. Ya. Bogucharsky and P. Ye. Schegolev, he founded the periodic journal "The Past" in Petersburg.

	The magazine was published monthly, with books in 20 printed sheets each. The publishing house and the editorial staff were successively located on Spasskaya Street (25), Znamenskaya Street (19), Liteiny Prospect (21).

	Were published valuable information about the processes of NG Chernyshevsky , MI Mikhailov , DI Pisarev and NA Serno-Solovyevich , as well as a number of memoirs of the Narodniks. The magazine was published in a large circulation (about 30 thousand copies). He was subjected to repression and on the 10th (22nd) book in 1907 was closed. In 1908, the magazine "Past years" was published instead of it, and Burtsev resumed the publication of the magazine in Paris - in 1908-1913, No. 7-15 was published. A prominent place in it was occupied by documents on the terrorist activities of the Socialist-Revolutionaries ; separate materials about the revolution of 1905-1907 , secret government documents, data on provocateurs were also published.

	From July 1917 in Petrograd, the publication of the magazine was resumed by the co-operative publishing association of the same name, which, in addition to 35 issues of the magazine (with a circulation of up to 6,000 copies), produced more than 50 books of historical and revolutionary themes based mainly on archival materials. The editors of the journal in 1917, in addition to Shchegolev and Burtsev, were V. V. Vodovozov and E. V. Tarle ; from 1918 - Schegolev. Much of the material was devoted to the revolutionary movement of the twentieth century. Many materials were not missed by the Soviet censorship , which was vigilantly following the direction of the magazine. Numbers 36 and 37 were not published and appeared only in 1991.

A review of the book:

https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://magazines.russ.ru/neva/2013/4/l9-pr.html&prev=search

	...The forerunner of the magazine "The Past" should be called "Historical-revolutionary collection" Byloe ", published by Vladimir Lvovich Burtsev (1862-1942) 5 in London-Geneva-Paris in 1900-1904. In the late autumn of 1905 he returned from exile to Russia, settled in the capital and asked permission from the authorities to continue publishing the historical collections "The Past" in Petersburg, which he was immediately denied6. VL Burtsev appealed to V. Ya. Bogucharsky and PE Shchegolev to become the official editors of the magazine he planned, and he and the owner of the publishing house "Don speech" Nikolai Yelpidiforovich Paramonov (1876-1951) 7 freely received permission to publish a monthly magazine "Past", dedicated to the history of the liberation movement. VL Burtsev actually became a full-fledged co-editor of the journal. His job was to collect the materials kept by the old revolutionaries. In October 1907, the decree of the St. Petersburg mayor published the magazine "The Past" was "suspended." In March 1909, by decision of the St. Petersburg Trial Chamber, P. Ye. Schegolev was sentenced to three years of solitary confinement "for distributing works of deliberately provoking rebellion". B. Ya. Bogucharsky was deported abroad, an experienced VL Burtsev, who was repeatedly expelled, Russia left in good time. The publication of the "Bylogo" resumed in 1917 and continued until 1926. Its editor and publisher was PE Shchegolev.

	...ARCHIVES, WITNESSES

	At the end of February - beginning of March 1917, almost simultaneously throughout Russia, fires burned, in which the documents of the Security Departments, the Gendarmerie Directorates, the Police Department and other services of the Ministry of the Interior of the Empire burned. The flame was absorbing priceless documents.

	In the first days of the February Revolution, enraged crowds of metropolitan residents set fire to the District Court building on Liteiny Prospekt and the old prison, the Lithuanian Castle, near the Theater Square. They burned to the ground. The fires broke out in the building of the Police Department on the Fontanka near the Panteleymonovsky Bridge and on Mytninskaya Embankment, where the Petrograd Security Department was smashed and burned. These two buildings with their contents were set on fire intentionally. Many wanted to exterminate the archives of the Security Department and the Special Department of the Police Department, they needed oblivion of the past as a guarantee of future existence.

	"True, here and there the gendarmerie officers managed to destroy lists of provocateurs," wrote the publicist SG Svatikov, "in some places a crowd, instigated by security agents, did not understand the meaning of what was happening, defeated the Security Departments and burned their archives and records. For example, a significant part of the archives of the Petrograd security department perished " [251] .

	All those who left memories of these strange fires of the spring of 1917 believed that their former guards had organized them.

	"Before the building of the Police Department," wrote the well-known archivist V. Maksakov, "huge fires of papers, documents, deeds, photographic cards thrown from the windows burned day and night on the Fontanka and Panteleymonovskaya street. In the room most of the cabinets were hacked, and books, files, individual papers piles covered the floors of a huge building. Some departments, for example, VIII office work, which dealt with cases of combating crime, were completely destroyed. Others suffered considerably. Fortunately, the room in which the Special Section of the Police Department was located did not suffer much. Here were the most valuable materials in the historical sense. They have been preserved almost completely " [252] .

	Someone reported on what was happening on the Fontanka in the Pushkin House of the Academy of Sciences. The indispensable secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Academician SF Oldenburg, was able to obtain several wagons, and an expedition consisting of PE Shchegolev, BL Modzalevsky, tl. A. Kotlyarevsky, A. S. Polyakov, A. A. Shilov, V. P. Semennikov and others, went to save the most valuable archives [253] . All that was saved, on March 3, was loaded into a sleigh and taken to the Vasilievsky Island to the Academy of Sciences. (Some of the saved documents were lost in 1918 when the archives were evacuated to Yaroslavl.) [254]

	In Moscow on March 1, 1917 in the palace along Gnezdnikovsky Lane, 5, bonfires flamed. Documents of the Security Department were burning. Someone wore papers in the bonfires, someone took for a folder, photos, brochures. "It was difficult to understand," wrote Maksakov, "who was more in this crowd," curious or former guards who aspired, as late as possible, to conceal in the fire of fires their traces of participation in the protection of the failed autocratic system. That there were a lot of former guards in the crowd could be seen from the fact that when checking the cases of the "secret police", especially its so-called "secret service department," it was subsequently found out that the lack of mainly personal files of secret employees, "agent notes" such documents, apparently, not accidentally disappeared during the "spontaneous" rout of the "secret police" and police stations.

	On the same day, a group of politicians and historians organized the protection of the documents of the "secret police" and their transportation to Red Square to the Moscow Historical Museum, where the reading room of the museum was adapted to accommodate archival materials " [255] .

	The situation was much worse in the provinces. There, the security offices burned simultaneously with the capital, first of all they destroyed personal affairs of secret employees and normative documents regulating the methods of the political investigation. News of the widespread destruction of the detective institutions of the former empire prompted the Provisional Government to urgently establish a Commission under the Ministry of Justice to liquidate the political affairs of the former Police Department. It was headed by the former Narodovolets VL Burtsev, who paid very little time to the Commission, which left part of the archives in the custody of their former custodians, officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Provisional Government "ordered the protection of police archives only when the official custodians left their posts and when many documents had already been plundered and destroyed" [256] .

	Seeing that the Burtsov Commission is inactive, on March 13, 1917, the Minister of Justice signed a letter with the following content:

	"I propose to Comrade Prosecutor Sluchevsky, PE Shchegolev, VM Zenzinov, NN Myasoyedov and Ensign Znamensky to review in the shortest possible time the documents seized in the Police Department and other institutions at my disposal and the results inform me.

	Minister of Justice AF Kerensky " [257] .

	The Burtsev commission was formally liquidated on June 15, 1917. Five days before its formation, the Provisional Government formed an Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry to investigate the unlawful actions of former ministers and other senior officials of civil, military and naval agencies [258] . In her work constantly participated: the famous Moscow lawyer NK Muraviev (chairman), senators SV Ivanov and SV Zavadsky (deputy chairmen), the chief military prosecutor VA Apushkin, the prosecutor of the Kharkov Chamber of Justice B. N. Smitten, prosecutor of the Moscow District Court LP Olyshev, academician S. F. Oldenburg, prosecutor of the Vilnius Chamber of Judges A. F. Romanov, representative of the State Duma F. I. Rodichev, from the Executive Committee of the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies N. D. Sokolov and the only historian P. Ye. Schegolev. The Commission invited the poet AA Blok to assist the journalist Mikhail Miklashevsky and the writer L. Ya. Gurevich, the scientific editorial staff, and the editorial staff was assisted by Professor E. Tarle.

	...Serving in the III department and the Police Department, Kletochnikov regularly passed on to the Narodnaya Volya heard from "colleagues" and read in the documents of these institutions. They came down to us in the form of copies copied by the Narodnaya Volunteers NA Morozov, LA Tikhomirov, SA Ivanova, and Ye. N. Figner. They contain valuable information about the political investigation and its secret employees. [151] . Based on these records, VL Burtsev published lists of secret agents disclosed by Kletochnikov [152] . They contain a description of 332 people. Mostly it's informers and episodic informers, only a small number of them can be attributed to provocateurs. Of course, this list can not claim to be exhaustive.

	...After the February Revolution, the commissions for the survey of archives of institutions subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs were formed outside the former Russian Empire. In March 1917, an émigré committee was formed in Paris, appealing to the Provisional Government with a request "for the admission of committee representatives to the sealed premises of the Foreign Agency for analyzing archives and for ascertaining the composition of secret employees" [264] . At the beginning of April, the Minister of Justice, AF Kerensky, and the chairman of the Extraordinary Investigation Commission, N. K. Muraviev, sent telegrams to Paris with a request to create a special commission to review the archives of the foreign secret police and send it to Russia. One of the Commission members VK Agafonov recalled: "On the doors of the Foreign Agency, located on the ground floor of the Russian consulate in Paris, we found the seals of the consulate and the personal seal of Krasilnikov, the head of the agency; removing them and unlocking the doors that were on the constipation, with two keys, not without excitement we entered the mysterious Parisian "secret police", consisting of only two relatively small rooms ... Here it is, the center from where the invisible hand directed its blows to the very heart of the Russian political emigration, there was a spider web that enveloped us and our comrades with a thousand thin but strong threads; here, we thought, satanic temptations were committed, and weak or already corrupted became final traitors " [265] .

	The archives of the overseas secret police were not burnt, they did not break, but he did not fully transfer to the new government. Krasilnikov and his assistants, before they sealed the security offices, some of the papers were withdrawn from the archive and not all were returned at the request of the commission.

	Two metropolitan commissions ceased to exist (the Commission for the Provision of the New Order and the Commission for Political Archives were dissolved), established in Moscow in March 1917 to save and preserve the archives of the institutions of the former Police Department, the various provincial commissions and the Commission for the Review of the Archive of the Overseas Secretaries ceased to function.

	Archives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and institutions subordinated to him, or rather, what remained of them, were in the hands of the new government. Historians and participants of the revolutionary movement used the first few years of some preserved documents. Then access to these archives was closed to all. But immediately after the October Revolution, many documents of the archives of the former Police Department were sealed [266] , and there is reason to believe that they have not been studied so far.

	The charge against Kerensky of double dealing with Kornilov has been satisfactorily refuted by Kerensky in his recent book, as Mr Wilcox admits in an appendix.

	Vladimir Lvovich Burtzev, active chiefly as a revolutionary propagandist in Petersburg and abroad after the failure of the 1905 uprising, had been a leading terrorist twenty and more years earlier. Now, though venerated by the younger generation of insurgents for his past achievements and appreciated for his present propaganda services, he was considered too meek and gentle to mix into current terrorist plotting.   He was never a member of any of the numerous revolutionary committees nor admitted to the inner councils.   He was above all not privy to the dead secrecy of assassination conspiracies.


Burtsev was a terrorist?


	...Whiffs of Treachery 	 
 	 
	In 1905 an unknown, veiled woman delivered a letter to a member of the underground at Petersburg which claimed that the Okhrana had two spies in the Socialist Revolutionaries' Combat Unit, a certain T., ex-convict, and the engineer Azev, a Jew recently arrived from abroad. Since Evno Azev was actually the top leader of the Combat Unit and the party's chief organizer of terror, the letter was dismissed by the revolutionaries as obviously an Okhrana trick. Azev himself, however, recognized the ex-convict T. as Tatarov, whom he knew to be another Okhrana penetration. He was anxious to deflect the threat to his own position and so urged an inquiry. Tatarov, interrogated by a commission, admitted nothing that would lead to proof of his betrayal, but he contradicted himself enough to increase the suspicion against him.   He was suspended from the party and finally, on Azev's motion, shot in his home at Kiev.
 
	Burtzev studied the Tatarov case. He realized that it would be preposterous for the Central Committee to prefer charges against Azev; on the other hand, Azev's furious insistence that Tatarov be killed struck him as excessive. There were ample indications in new denunciations and in the failure of planned terroristic acts that there was still, with Tatarov dead, a traitor in the party. Studying the failures, Burtzev noted that almost as a rule at assassination attempts, whether successful or not, Azev was never on the scene.


detective Burtsev mathematically proves you're a peice of shit and there's nothing you can do

	...In 1908 an agent of the Warsaw Okhrana who had decided to defect, Mikhail Bakai, approached Burtzev in Petersburg in his position as editor of the revolutionary journal Byloe (The Past). He offered a mass of information about the Okhrana and its Warsaw office that convinced Burtzev of his bona fides. Burtzev talked him into staying in place a little longer, until he had collected more information on the identities of secret agents. This gamble almost failed; soon thereafter Bakai was arrested and sent to Siberia. But he escaped and came again to Burtzev. Among the new information he had acquired was the identity of the penetration agent who had reported his intention to defect and so caused his arrest.   His name was Raskin.
 	 
	The revolutionaries did not know that Raskin was the Okhrana's name for Azev; still, this was a pointer for Burtzev


Got info from Mikhail Bakai


	...The Azev case was only the beginning of a flood of exposures. Bakai had brought the names or aliases of thirty-odd agents connected with the Okhrana's Warsaw branch. Moreover, an Okhrana headquarters staff officer, Leonid Menshchikov, had also defected just before Bakai. Although he had only the code names and fragmentary information on the activities of penetration agents, he provided leads that Burtzev patiently pursued until in June of 1909 he could announce to the world that the celebrated socialite Arkadiy Harting, who as head of the Okhrana abroad was chiefly responsible for its prestige in Western Europe, was actually a miserable little provocateur and since 1890 a fugitive from French justice for his part in a terrorist plot. Paris Okhrana never recovered fully from this blow.
 
	Thus Burtzev, once looked upon as an obnoxious meddler, a disgruntled has-been making irresponsible accusations, became the heroic "Sherlock Holmes of the Russian Revolution" and chief adversary of the Okhrana as counterintelligence officer first for the Social Revolutionaries and their Combat Unit, then for the Leninist Social Democrats, the Anarcho-Communists, and other groups. His triumphant operations would before long begin to turn sour, but in the meantime they had their day. 


So Burtsev and defectors uncover a bunch of Okhrana plots and he becomes "Sherlock Holmes of the Revolution"

was "chief adversary of the Okhrana" for Social Revolutionaries, Leninist Social Dmmeocrats, Anarcho-Communists, and others.


	...After his permanent move to Paris in 1908, Burtzev maintained a residence at 116 rue de la Glaciere until October 1914. From the beginning this apartment served also as his editorial office, first for the weekly Byloe, then for Budushchee (The Future).   It was thus here that he met party leaders, members of various committees, and the general public and kept his library and intelligence files. As his intelligence activities expanded, however, he rented several other offices and also made operational use of the quarters of his principal assistants, initially Mikhail Bakai and the lawyer and journalist Valerian Agafonov. 


Started his counter-intel op with Bakai and Valerian Agafonov.


	...Burtzev's triumph had been due partly to Agafonov and a split among Socialist Revolutionaries. The party's Central Committee had been formed in Paris under the leadership of a few exiled revolutionaries of considerable wealth such as Viktor Chernov and Mark Natanson.   In frequent conflict with these leaders were a number of professional people, lawyers and journalists in exile, most of them struggling for their livelihood. These, like Burtzev, considered the leaders too lax and complacent about the possibility of Okhrana penetrations. In 1908 they were organized as an "Opposition Group" of about a hundred members by Agafonov, who started publishing their small journal, Revolutsionnaia Mysl (Revolutionary Thought). Agafonov was assisted by Gnatovsky and Yudelevsky. 


Burtsev and other revolutionaries thought wealthy "revolutionaries" like Cernov and Natanson were too lax about Okhrana penetrations.


	...Burtzev joined the Group at once and published in the new journal an article, entitled "Black Book of the Russian Liberation Movement," concerning exposed Okhrana agent Mechislav Kensitski and others accused of being traitors to the revolution; this was the beginning of his campaign against penetrations. More importantly, he thus acquired the leaders of the opposition as his voluntary assistants and agents, who gathered frequently in secret meetings and brought him information on the doings and contacts of all the active revolutionaries.
 	 
	Okhrana chief Harting was, until his own exposure, fully informed of these developments and the progress of Burtzev's debriefing of defectors Menshchikov and Bakai. He had a penetration who was a member of the Opposition Group and so in constant touch with Burtzev and Agafonov. This agent now reported further that the Group, instead of searching in toto for spies and traitors, was forming a smaller special unit named the "Group of the Activist Minority" to watch closely the party members suspected of treason.   Agafonov and Ankel Yudelevsky headed this select body and reported to Burtzev daily. 


Burtsev was really into Okhrana penetration of the revolution and watched those suspected carefully. The Okhrana also took notice and watched him.


	...Bakai's Liga was a covert arm for Burtzev, who apparently did not trust his own office to be free of Okhrana agents (as it actually never was). The Liga was so completely conspiratorial that: even important members of the party were not given its address. Its task was to collect intelligence on the Okhrana and its agents and to investigate clandestinely the life of every member of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, his income, associations, and loyalty to the cause.   Harting expressed to headquarters his prescient apprehension about the Liga's activities and urged that all measures be taken to expel Bakai and Burtzev, as well as Agafonov and other "Activist Minority" leaders, from France.   He argued that neither in England nor in Switzerland could such revolutionary counterintelligence efforts cause as much damage as in France.
 
	In Okhrana terminology the task of Agafonov's Activist Minority was essentially internal, penetration of the Okhrana's penetrations, while Bakai's Liga was largely external, doing surveillance and detective-type investigations. Both units reported directly to Burtzev. Both of them, along with Burtzev's own office on the rue de la Glaciere, at first depended for support on the not large and not affluent Opposition Group. The funds were meager, but the agents were for the most part avid volunteers, often with moderate incomes of their own. 


Was head of counter-Okhrana intelligence and tried to penetrate their penetrations too


hired a guy named Leroy who knew a lot about the Okhrana's activities in France


	...In a number of operations during 1909 Burtzev arranged for the two external units, or at least their leaders, to work together. When it was learned that Harting was living incognito somewhere in Belgium, Burtzev quickly worked out a plan to locate him and if possible bring him clandestinely back to France, where the police would be alerted to arrest him. Burtzev thought this course would be of greatest propaganda value for the revolutionaries, but if kidnaping and delivery to France were impossible, they could carry out in Belgium the death sentence of their underground tribunal. Bakai and Leroy spent some three months of late 1909 in Belgium with their agents, Bakai investigating at Verviers, Leroy at Liege. They were confident of eventual success, but Harting had been informed of their assignment even before they left Paris. 


they tried to catch Harting, but Hartin was tipped-off


	...Burtzev was a most aggressive operator.   He did not wait for leads to put him on the track of traitors; he created situations to produce the leads. Early in April of 1912, for example, Paris Okhrana received two letters, one addressed to the ambassador and the other to the consul general, from unknown persons offering their services as agents.   Not suspecting that both were written by Burtzev's service, the Okhrana wrote back giving the two applicants appointments at different times and places. It even gave one a second appointment in response to a plea that the first reply had arrived too late. Neither of the two ever showed up.
 
	But two of the addresses proposed for the meetings were, as Burtzev had suspected, used also for the mailed reports of penetration agents. His only purpose in the fake applications had been to obtain such addresses. His surveillance men now went to work and intercepted the mail for them, which gave him the code names of two Okhrana agents, Karpo and Kodak.


Burtsev would use tricks to extract info out of the Okhrana


	...One case in which Burtzev was completely wrong was that of a revolutionary activist named Smolyansky. In falsely accusing him of being an Okhrana agent, he built his case entirely on circumstantial evidence. This included the suspect's intercepted mail and letters from accusers, anonymous and signed. His :income was unexplained, and his movements were suspicious. One of his purloined writings was about the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, and Burtzev saw this as clearly the draft for an agent report. Then Burtzev received a report that a brother of Smolyansky's was a police official in Russia. He regarded the evidence as sufficient to warrant exposing the man as an agent. 


But Burtsev got too confident and got one accusation wrong


	...On 19 April, without explanation, both prisoners were told the death sentence was commuted. The revolutionaries had apparently decided it would be too dangerous to carry out the execution: too many people knew about the trial and the concierge had seen too much; the liquidation could be done later, away from Paris. The prisoners were told that they were expelled from the party but would have to report all changes of address. Both were released.
 	 
	Tatiana was given back 40 francs of her money.   She took a train to Germany. Three armed revolutionaries accompanied her, but she succeeded in escaping from them. She returned to Russia and told the Okhrana this story.


They catch Tatiana and she admits it, but for some reason decide to let her go and she tells the Okhrana.


	...After Burtzev's triumph in exposing Azev and Harting, no revolutionary group was able to refuse his services or to ignore his warnings and directives. The central committees had to accept him in their councils and consult him on the security of projected operations and the loyalty of participating activists. Thus he acquired a peculiar authority over revolutionary operations and the top party leaders. He was frequently able to tell them to change or drop their operational plans.
 
	After Natanson and Chernov, for example, had in 1913 approved a project to dispatch Ziama Kisin with a team to Petersburg to murder Minister of Education Kaso, Burtzev warned them that the conspiracy might have been penetrated by the Okhrana. When they wanted to go ahead with the operation despite his warnings, he threatened to expose them as provocateurs if anything should go wrong.   They had to drop the plan. 


Burtsev so good that he had power over their operations and people were afraid of him


	...His authoritarian attitude led to a gradual loss of support from the Socialist Revolutionaries and other groups of political exiles. He became chronically short of the funds required to maintain his expanded services. Bakai, after he broke with him, wrote him a public letter in which he charged him with squandering money


but it might have got the best of him


	...Opposition to Burtzev increased particularly in the first months of 1914. Rumors were spread to show him full of naivete or senile. He was called an old autocrat who conjured up suspects by intuition, without factual intelligence information and proof. He was charged with an obsession for exposing police agents regardless of how much he hurt the revolutionary movement. 


Burtsev was really into exposing the Okhrana, but Bolsheviks didn't see to mind as much.


	...With a new series of errors in exposing Okhrana agents the criticism came to a head in mid-1914, and Burtzev lost all financial support from the revolutionary groups. His teams of French external agents disintegrated because their salaries were not paid, and his wide circle of Russian collaborators gradually deserted him. By the time the war broke out in August he was actually destitute, without support from anywhere and thus without a service. He returned to Russia, escaping a throng of creditors to face in the imperial courts the charges of sedition against him.


eventually they got him in mid-1914, Burtsev lost funding, and apparently Revolutionaries lost their counter-intelligence.


	...There had been times when Vladimir Lvovich had been wanted dead or alive by the Tsarist regime. Returning to Petrograd in wartime, however, he found the authorities unexpectedly lenient. A free man even before the first revolution broke out, he went back to newspaper work in 1917, publishing Obshchee Delo (Common Cause). He now became an ardent critic of Bolshevism. Despite his many past services for Lenin's party, therefore, he found it healthiest to return to exile soon after the October Revolution. In Paris he continued his Obshchee Delo for several years. His death came in 1942 at the age of 80. 


sometimes wanted dead or alive by Okhrana. They were unexpectedly lenient to him when he returned to Petrograd, and he went back to publishing a newspaper in 1917 while being anti-Bolshevik. Had to return to exile after October revolution.

	One question, which both Ambassadors had to 
raise, was of peculiar delicacy; and both he and Buchanan were 
seriously embarrassed when they were called upon by their 
Governments to plead the cause of Vladimir Burtsev. This is one 
of the most remarkable characters in the whole of our story. He 
was closely in touch with the revolutionary parties, and he was 
specially interested in terrorism, as a weapon to be used only when 
the Government refused all concessions to public opinion. He was 
at one time not inappropriately tried, sentenced and imprisoned 
in England for his frank publication of this view. But his interest 
was not that of an agent but of a scholar, and it is typical that he 
was arrested on coming out of the British Museum. He was the 
best expert on the history of the revolutionary movement and was 
in fact, so to speak, a revolutionary detective, with a ‘flair’ superior 
to that of any of the police. He was constantly exposing the 
Russian police agents abroad, with such success that at one time 
they all had to be changed: so we are told by Beletsky himself, 
who was then Director of the Police Department. ^ It was Burtsev, 
who, with unflagging cleverness and assiduity, had ultimately 
succeeded in proving to the leaders of the Social Revolutionaries 
that the president of their terrorist section, Azef, was serving 
simultaneously as a police spy. Burtsev, under certain circum- 
stances, could defend or even advocate terrorism, but, as he has 
put it, ‘he objected to murders by a police agent’. So unwilhng 
were they to listen to him that at one time he was in danger at their 
hands; but ultimately his proofs were so thorough and convincing 
that Azef was tried by his colleagues, condemned and shovelled 
away into retirement, where later his accuser paid him a friendly 
and scholarly visit to verify some doubtful point. Burtsev used to 
talk freely to the heads of the Police Department. His method was 
to start by showing them a good part of what he already knew and 
thereby extract more. No one ever had such an intimate know- 
ledge of the scum of Russian politics on both sides of that vague line 
which separated the police from the revolutionaries. 


Burtsev knew his shit

	Immediately after the Revolution of March 
1917 Kerensky, as the new Minister of Justice, set up his investi- 
gating commission manned by some of the best lawyers in Russia 
which interrogated in detail all the chief actors in this period. The 
questions put to them, according to the most clement procedure 
of western justice, were exactly those on which we should most 
desire information, and we have verbatim their answers. 

	It is from this last-named abundant material that we draw our 
principail information on the period which is now being described. 
Two of the chief villains of the piece — for this period S. P. 
Beletsky, and for a later period A. D. Protopopov — proving 
amenable in examination to give in detail all that they knew, 
were invited by the Chairman of the Commission to write it out 
in full; and one of the seven volumes of this report is devoted 
entirely to these two men, and mainly to the record of Beletsky. 
He took a certain curious literary pride in writing it, though it 
is in a florid and involved style, almost German in kind, suggestive 
of an official police report; in fact he calls it ‘an act of accusation 
against myself’; ^ but it is full of detailed and balanced statements, 
which can often be verified from other sides. Burtsev, who knew 
Beletsky well, considers that it can be trusted entirely. “ It is quite 
frank and tells the story exactly as any intelligent person would 
see it, almost without self-consciousness and quite without any 
mercy for his own part in it. He begins with the words: ‘I will 
write my evidence or rather my confession’; and he stops at some 
of the most extravagant facts which he has to relate, to say how 
even he was compelled to blush for his part in them,® or to ex- 
claim: ‘I was bathing in dirt.’* 

	Stephen Beletsky, who was personally known to me, was 
a typical professional police official, a thorough man of the world, 
very careful and resourceful in detail, who by years of able service 
in various posts had before the War risen to that of Director of the 
Department of Police. He was not an honest man, and could 
never have been regarded as such, whether by himself or by 
others; but he had exactly the abilities required by his office.


Burtsev and Bernard Pares vouch for the credibility of a testimony by Beletski


but iirc Pares is sketchy

	This circumstance gave Bogrov the hope that he could commit a terrorist act not over Kulyabka, but over the Tsar or Stolypin. On August 30 or 31, Bogrov saw both the Tsar and Stolypin, but for some reason he did not dare to shoot. On September 1, he finally decided to shoot Stolypin. The last motive for this decision was the fact that Bogrov believed that on that day his relations with the security department were fully established by his comrades, since his conversation with Kulyabka was overheard by one of his comrades. That Bogrov was the most active anarchist, I know from a statement that I received, for example, in 1912 from a hard labor prison from his comrade, now an employee of the "Russian Gazette", released from hard labor under a full amnesty, Sandomirsky. I printed Sandomirsky's letter in the same year in 1912 in The Future, where Sandomirsky denies the possibility of Bogrov's service in the security department, speaks of him as the most active Kiev anarchist. In the "Future" (No. 3), I autographed Bogrov with his autograph of his report on the assignments assigned to him by the party. About the fact that Bogrov served in the security department, received money and gave information, in addition to official documents, I know from private conversations with people who served in the political police, for example - Dobroskok, Spiridovich, etc. I often heard opinions about , that Bogrov had some kind of contact with Kulyabka, Kurlov and Spiridovich in the murder of Stolypin.

	October 25, 1917, the day of storming the Winter Palace, Burtsev issued the first and only issue of the newspaper "Our Common Cause." His editorial began with the words: "Citizens, save Russia!". The number was confiscated - this time by order of Trotsky, and the journalist was arrested the same day and again fell into the Trubetskoi bastion of the Peter and Paul Fortress, in which he was sitting under Alexander III and under Nicholas II. Burtsev, thus, became the first political prisoner of Soviet Russia - the Ministers of the Provisional Government joined him later. Among them, by the way, was the former director of the police department Beletsky, from which the journalist did not depart a single step.

	The Bolsheviks planted Burtsev, of course, not for an article. The fact is that in July 1917 he published a list of the names of 159 emigrants who returned to Russia through the territory of Germany. Burtsev was quite sure: "The October 25, 1917 coup that overthrew the authority of the Provisional Government and established the power of the Soviets was committed by the Germans through their agents, on their money and on their instructions."



So what was going on here? the "Citizens! Save Russia!" article was also where he was said to have attacked General Verkhovsky

from Burtsev's memoirs:

	The danger to the right for me was clear even then, under Alexander III, but it became even clearer under Nicholas II - especially in the autumn of 1916, when the rightists were ruining Russia and preparing chaos in Russia. 
   The danger to the left was clear to me even then. It could be seen even more clearly in 1905, Her only blind man could not see in 1914-16, - I'm not talking about 1917, when the power was in the hands of Kerensky and his adherents, who themselves imagined a state danger.
   But both among the rightists and among the left - the minority in both camps - there were certain state trends that the people's interests always placed above their program and who would never want to make an experimental field from the people to apply their doctrines. 
   I attached great importance to the union of these two trends, left and right, and in their mutual struggle saw a huge, menacing danger for Russia. 
   I was convinced that only their union and can ensure the proper development of the country and bring it to the broad road of free true democracy.


interesting--Burtsev see the same problem of left and right divided in his country, leading it to catastrophe?
