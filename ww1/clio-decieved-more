	To expedite this hectic activity, the War Guilt Section in 1921 had established a psuedo-scholarly bureau, the Center for the Study of the Causes of the War. Headed until August 1923 by a Swiss doctor, Ernst Sauerbeck, and thereafter until its dissolution in 1937 by Major Alfred von Wegerer, it became "a clearinghouse for officially desireable views on the outbreak of the war." The Center possessed only a small staff of "politically trained" scholars, but its directory included such notables as Count von Montgelas, Bernhard W. von Bulow, Hans Delbruck, and Hermann Lutz. The prolific Wegerer, who had come aboard in 1923 from the volkisch "Liga fur deutsch Kultur," churned out no less than 300 articles to buttress the revisionist cause. The Foreign Ministry, at the height of the economic crisis of 1923, financed a monthyl journal for the Center entitled Die Kriegshuldfrage, Monatsschrift fur Internationale Aufklarung, which in 1929 changed its title to Berliner Monatshefte. Its circulation hovered between 2,500 and 3,000 copies in 1925, then climbed to between 3,500 and 4,000 by 1931. Both journals of the Zentralstelle zur Erforschung der Kriegursachen appeared with the "Quader-Verlag," a publishing house financially controlled by the Foreign Ministry--much in the manner in which the latter kept the "Deutsche Verlagsanstalt fur Politik und Geschichte" solvent by having it publish the works that the Wilhelmstrasse contracted out to Bulow, Lutz, Mendellsohn-Bartholdy, Montgelas, Schucking, Schwertfeger, Stieve, and Thimme. Again, Wergerer and his Center appeared on the surface to be independent; in reality, Wegerer remained in the pay of the Foreign Ministry in the position of Ministerialrat, and the War Guilt Section "supervised" the Center's publications.

	Unfortunately, there is no concise accounting of the subsidies paid out by the Foreign Ministry for tis campaign of revision. Ulrich Heinmann has shown that Wergerer's Center received official support in the amount of 23,400 Mark in 1924-25, 34,400 Mark the following year, and 84,00 Mark by 1929-30; private contributions amounted to 5,200 Mark, 19,000 Mark, and 24,000 Mark for those respective years. These sums can best be gauged against the 120 Mark monthly wage of an average German industrial worker. Of course, these monies formed only a very small part of the overall outlays of the Foreign Ministry to the "war-guilt lie." Nor is it possible to gain any accurate insight into the number of independent scholars and journalists engaged by the Wilhelmstrasse in a similar function. While Geiss speaks of a small army of such publicists, Heinmann tends toward a much smaller number. In the main, these writers were paid modest honorariums of perhaps several hundred Mark in order to pen three or four articldes per month for leading newspapers, which in turn passed them on to the provincial press.
