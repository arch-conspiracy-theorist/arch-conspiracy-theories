Hello,

I post a lot on Russia's influence operations. I put a lot of effort into my posts and I believe I've gotten a bit of a following. However, many of my posts are being deleted without explanation:

There might be others, but this is what I've found so far. I have messaged the moderators, but I haven't gotten a straightforward explanation for why these posts were deleted.

The pattern in these deletions are especially concerning, since Russian propagandists are said to try to control social media (see [here](http://www.smh.com.au/world/fake-news-why-the-west-is-blind-to-russias-propaganda-today-20170123-gtxbuw.html
), other reports, Congressional hearings). It would reflect poorly on reddit if it turned out that major subreddits were being ran by Russian propagandists.
