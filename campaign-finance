	Nestled in House Spending Bill: Campaign Finance Deregulation

	...The multiple provisions—called riders—are prompting pushback from campaign-finance watchdogs, who generally favor tighter restrictions on money in politics.

	...Riders are frequently inserted into appropriation bills as a way to pass controversial policies without having them voted on individually, because they would “ride along” with a larger spending bill.

	When Florida Republican David Jolly came to Washington after winning a special election in 2014, he was surprised by what he was told was his No. 1 priority: fundraising.

	The House member told “60 Minutes” he sat behind closed doors with party leadership, where he was told he had six months to raise $2 million.

	“Your job, new member of Congress, is to raise $18,000 a day. Your first responsibility is to make sure you hit $18,000 a day,” he said he was told.

	...Since the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, he said, both parties have told new members they should spend 30 hours a week on calls — and the prospect is keeping people from running for office.

	...The Citizens United Foundation, another conservative tax-exempt charity, would soon pay Bannon hundreds of thousands for fundraising and film consulting.

	...the Freedom Center and others in the network were rising on the Trump tide. The campaign named Bannon the chief executive, David Bossie of Citizens United the vice president and Miller an adviser.

	But the prospects of passage for the bill are low — it only has six co-sponsors and some opponents say it’s a cosmetic fix that has no chance of becoming law.

	Another provision would continue to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from implementing a long-stalled rule that would better define the limits on political activities of organizations exempt from income taxes under section 501(C)(4) of the tax code. By law, such organizations are supposed to be “operated exclusively” for social welfare purposes, but the IRS has interpreted the law to allow them to spend up to 49% of their money on political causes.

	How a ‘shadow’ universe of charities joined with political warriors to fuel Trump’s rise 

	...In August 1988, Horowitz launched the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in Los Angeles, a nonprofit group that would become the Freedom Center.

	Charities have been around since the nation’s beginning, as citizens sought to help schools, churches and the poor. Decades ago, Congress created a special section of the IRS code to define and regulate charities, which are known as 501(c)(3) groups under the code. They have a special allure for donors: They can deduct contributions from their taxes.

	IRS rules give charities wide latitude, but they may not devote a “substantial part” of their resources or activities to lobbying or “carrying on propaganda.” And they “are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office,” according to the IRS.

	In his IRS application for tax-exempt status in August 1988, Horowitz wrote his center would be “entirely non-profit, non-partisan,” according to records obtained through a public records request. “It will not be organized to promote any particular political program.”

Hersh wrote that Flynn told him that he sent a “constant stream” of warnings to the Obama administration about how dangerous it would be to topple the Assad regime. He said that “jihadists” controlled the opposition and Turkey wasn’t stopping the smuggling of foreign fighters into Syria.

	“If the American public saw the intelligence we were producing daily, at the most sensitive level, they would go ballistic,” Flynn said.

In 1972, Habash, as leader of the PFLP, publicly renounced international terrorism, provoking a bitter row with Haddad, who set up a new headquarters in Baghdad where he founded a PFLP splinter group, the Special Operations Group.

https://www.jihadwatch.org/islam-101
	4) Frequently Asked Questions

	...If Islam is violent, why are so many Muslims peaceful?

	This question is a bit like asking, “If Christianity teaches humility, tolerance, and forgiveness, why are so many Christians arrogant, intolerant, and vindictive?” The answer in both cases is obvious: in any religion or ideology there will be many who profess, but do not practice, its tenets. Just as it is often easier for a Christian to hit back, play holier-than-thou, or disdain others, so it is often easier for a Muslim to stay at home rather than embark on jihad. Hypocrites are everywhere.

	...as Islam takes greater root — increasing numbers of followers, the construction of more mosques and “cultural centers,” etc. — the greater the likelihood that some number of its adherents will take its violent precepts seriously. This is the problem that the West faces today.

	As in Soviet tmes the central and regional security services (the former KGB) have begun to infiltrate local communities and to compile lists of active and passive Islamists, as well as Islamist sympathisers.

	Sun Tzu said, "All warfare is based primarily on deception of your enemy. To fight on the battlefield to achieve your goals is the most primitive and barbaric to achieve your goals. The highest art of war is not to fight at all, but to subvert anything of value in your enemy's country." Which includes religion, moral principles, traditions, and natural established relationships between people, families, groups, classes, races. Turn the blacks against the whites; turn the teachers against students; turn Ralph Nader against the government; labor unions against business; homosexuals against heterosexuals; and keep on fighting, my dear friends, until you demoralize and destabilize yourself and then you flop like a rotten apple and the enemy will take you over.

	Trump understands that Russia is threatened by Sunni jihadists and that Russia views Iran as a counterweight to ISIS and its counterparts in the Caucasus. A deal between the US and Russia could involve a Russian agreement to end its support for Iran and Hezbollah in exchange for US acceptance of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, cancellation of sanctions and perhaps some form of acquiescence to Russia’s military presence in Syria.

	Russia and the US could then collaborate with Arab states with Israeli support to defeat ISIS and end the Syrian refugee crisis.

	The religious rider would allow churches to skirt the so-called Johnson Amendment. Named after its primary sponsor when he was senator, the late Lyndon Johnson, the 1954 rule prohibits 501(C)(3) nonprofit organizations—such as churches—from endorsing or opposing political candidates. While the IRS has rarely enforced the ban, the rider could give violators a free pass.

	The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group, is lobbying to repeal the Johnson Amendment and has worked with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) to introduce a bill that would do so, according to its website.

	“A nonprofit organization should not lose its tax-exempt status or be threatened with audits because it exercises its constitutional right to speak in favor of political candidates who share the organization’s values and mission,” the group argues.


https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicj85.pdf
	Another recent court case agreed with the Service that an organization violated well-defined standards of public policy and did not qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) exemption. However, unlike the Bob Jones case, the organization was engaged in clear-cut violations of the law. The Church of Scientology of California, Commissioner, 83 T.C. No. 25 (1984).

	The court concluded that on the basis of all the facts of record the organization's overriding purpose was to make money, and that criminal manipulation of the IRS to maintain its tax exemption (and the exemption of affiliated churches) was a crucial and purposeful element of the organization's financial planning. The court described this purpose as a conspiracy the major features of which were to block the IRS from investigating, determining, and collecting taxes from the organization and its affiliated churches. It stated that the conspiracy covered 8 years and involved the manufacture and falsification of records submitted to the IRS, burglarizing the IRS offices and stealing government documents, and subverting government processes for unlawful purposes.

The long-running issue gained public notice in 2013, when the IRS apologized for targeting 501(c)(4) applications by tea-party and other conservative groups for closer scrutiny. The IRS subsequently proposed a rule aimed at clarifying limits on political activity by such groups. But many GOP lawmakers—as well as a range of advocacy groups—raised concerns, leading to the congressionally-imposed moratorium.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kushner
	In the summer of 2004, Kushner was fined $508,900 by the Federal Election Commission for contributing to Democratic political campaigns in the names of his partnerships when he lacked authorization to do so. In 2005, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Chris Christie negotiated a plea agreement with Kushner, under which he pleaded guilty to 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering. The witness-tampering charge arose from Kushner's act of retaliation against William Schulder, his sister Esther's husband, who was cooperating with federal investigators; Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranged to record an encounter between the two, and had the tape sent to his sister.


&nbsp;


http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/nyregion/major-donor-admits-hiring-prostitute-to-smear-witness.html
	The donor, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who has contributed millions of dollars to Democrats, is expected to serve 18 to 24 months in prison under his agreement with the United States attorney's office. He pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns and campaign finance reports in addition to one count of retaliating against a witness.

	Mr. Kushner's plea agreement, however, does not include cooperating with federal investigators in the underlying campaign finance investigation or in any others, including an inquiry involving former aides to Gov. James E. McGreevey. Mr. Kushner and businesses he controls gave more than $1.5 million to Mr. McGreevey and his campaign committees, and Mr. Kushner had business dealings with the governor's former campaign manager and chief of staff, Gary Taffet, now the subject of a federal investigation.

	Mr. Kushner was also nominated by the governor to lead the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, although he withdrew when some legislators raised objections.

	Speculation about Mr. Kushner's political connections has grown since Mr. McGreevey's startling admission last week of an adulterous homosexual affair. Mr. Kushner sponsored a work visa for Golan Cipel, an Israeli and a former adviser to the governor who has been identified as the man with whom Mr. McGreevey had the affair. Mr. Kushner also employed Mr. Cipel briefly before the governor hired him. But United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie and Mr. Kushner's lawyers both insisted, when pressed by reporters on Wednesday, that the timing of Mr. Kushner's plea had nothing to do with the recent news about the governor or Mr. Cipel.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGreevey#Golan_Cipel_controversy
	McGreevey was criticized for appointing as homeland security adviser Golan Cipel, because he lacked experience or other qualifications for the position. In addition, Cipel could not gain a security approval from the Federal government, as he was Israeli and not a U.S. citizen. McGreevey had met him in Israel during a trip there in 2000.

	A close review by The Record of Kushner’s donations in the last five years shows just how grand his largesse really is: In that time, Kushner, his family, and business associates funneled at least $3.1 million to political committees and politicians.

	Kushner’s four children gave almost $300,000, some even before they were old enough to vote. On a single day in March last year, Kushner’s contribution network gave $237,000 to the state Democratic Committee…

	Listed as contributors in the Kushner network are 85 family members and business partners in companies the developer controls.

	Kushner’s four children have given to the same causes as their father. His son Jared, a 21-year-old college student, is listed as making more than two dozen contributions totaling $82,000. Jared’s 17-year-old brother, Joshua, gave $44,000, while 19-year-old Nicole gave $67,000. On Nov. 1, 2000, Nicole and Joshua each wrote checks to the state Democratic Party – for $30,000 and $20,000.

	Kushner’s mother, Rae, is listed as contributing $72,000. Kushner’s brother-in-law and business partner, Richard Stadtmauer, and five members of Stadtmauer’s family have given $199,200 since 1997 to various Democrats and the aborted U.S. Senate campaign of former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. That total included $80,000 to McGreevey or to political committees that benefited him.

	Sometimes, it seemed that Kushner and the people around him could not write checks fast enough.

	On March 25 of [2001], the Democratic State Committee made this haul: two checks for $37,000 each from Kushner and his mother; $17,000 from Jared Kushner; $27,000 from his elder sister, Dara; and $27,000 from brother Murray – even though he generally aims his donations at Republicans. Five other Kushner partners and their family members also kicked in checks, to push the total take to $237,000.

	Illegal Campaign Donor to Torricelli Sentenced

	The man at the center of the criminal inquiry into the 1996 campaign of Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli was sentenced in Newark to 18 months in federal prison for illegal donations.

	Businessman David Chang was also fined $20,000 and barred from political fund-raising, one day after filing court papers in which he claimed the freshman senator had threatened his life and urged him to lie to investigators.

	The sentencing was the last major event in the three-year investigation into Torricelli's finances.

	Torricelli has denied having any knowledge about illegal donations.

	Corruption? Voters Say They Know It When They See It

	...The Carla Katz episode has not helped Mr. Corzine either, in the eyes of some voters. In August, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that he had provided a $470,000 mortgage to Ms. Katz, a former companion and the president of a union representing 9,000 state workers. The loan was seen as naïve at best, because as governor Mr. Corzine would have to negotiate with Ms. Katz over union contracts.

	Sen. Robert Menendez may have had sex with underage hookers in Dominican Republic: prosecutors 

	WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors said Monday that they aren’t convinced claims U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez cavorted with underage hookers – widely seen as discredited – are false.

	Lawyers for the New Jersey Democrat last week asked a federal judge to dismiss charges that the senator took bribes from a Florida eye doctor, Salomon Melgen, and in exchange used his power to do business and personal favors for him.

	The defense said the case is bogus because it sprang from "easily disprovable" claims that Menendez slept with underage prostitutes while hosted by Melgen at a Dominican Republic villa.

	...But in a motion Monday asking the judge to ignore the defense arguments, Justice Department lawyers say the hooker allegations "were not so easily disprovable as the defendants suggest."

	New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez indicted on corruption charges

	Sen. Bob Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants who rose to become one of the highest-ranking Hispanic members of Congress, was charged Wednesday with accepting nearly $1 million in gifts and campaign contributions from a longtime friend in exchange for a stream of political favors.

	..."I am not going anywhere. I'm angry and ready to fight because today contradicts my public service and my entire life," he said.

	A federal grand jury indictment accuses the New Jersey Democrat of using the power of his Senate seat to benefit Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye doctor who prosecutors say provided the senator with luxury vacations, airline travel, golf trips and tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to a legal defense fund.

	...The criminal charges cloud the political future of the top Democrat — and former chairman — of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has played a leading role on Capitol Hill on matters involving Iran's nuclear program and U.S. efforts to improve ties with Cuba. Menendez said Wednesday he would temporarily step aside from his role as top Democrat on the committee.

	Soviet-Era Program Gives Even Unoppressed Immigrants an Edge

	...The 1990 amendment, which was proposed by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, established a legal presumption of eligibility for refugee status for Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. That is a more lenient standard than for other refugee applicants, who must prove they face a well-founded fear of persecution.
