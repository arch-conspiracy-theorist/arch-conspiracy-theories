	Does the 'Soviet of Washington' deserve its lefty reputation? 


	...But our lefty reputation is older than that. (Exhibit A: statue of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in Fremont.)

	...Gregory begins with 1897 with Eugene Debs. Debs later became known for running for president as a Socialist, but before that Debs led a railroad worker strike and worked to replace the capitalist system.

	He believed the best tactic would be to bring as many Socialists as possible to one state to win elections.

	Communism in Washington State
	History and Memory

	Communism made a larger impact on Washington than almost any other state. “There are forty-seven states in the Union, and the Soviet of Washington,” Postmaster General James Farley joked in 1936. The remark, for all its exaggeration, had some foundation.

	The Communist movement, founded in 1919, caught on quickly in the Pacific Northwest, picking up members from the fading Industrial Workers of the World and Socialist Party. In the 1930s the CP played key roles in the strikes and campaigns that built some of the region’s most powerful unions and used that base to influence other institutions. The Washington Commonwealth Federation, the Washington Pension Union and to some extent the state’s Democratic party organization responded to these popular front initiatives. Running as Democrats, Communists won some important public offices, including a seat in Congress.

	During the Cold War the issue of Communism and the prominent role of the Party in the affairs of Washington state became a powerful weapon for conservatives. The state’s Red Scare began in 1947 and party members were soon driven out of most positions of influence. The purges took a heavy toll in jobs lost, families broken up, and organizations destroyed. Yet the CP survived the hard years...

	...Welcome to the Communism in Washington State-History and Memory project. ...The project is sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies at the University of Washington and is one of the Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights Projects

Washington has Soviet reputation


http://web.kitsapsun.com/archive/1996/06-15/348591_soviets_flocking_to_northwest.html
	SEATTLE (AP)  Tens of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union have come to Washington in the past 10 years, some at the express invitation of their Northwest employers.

	Almost 17,000 refugees from the region  many fleeing religious persecution  have sought assistance from the state Department of Social and Health Services, says program supervisor Jeff Kibler at the state Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance. They account for 18 percent of the total and are the second largest group of immigrants, behind Southeast Asians.

	But thousands more have arrived without official refugee status  skilled professionals who readily adapt to the West.

	The total likely exceeds 40,000, said Vladimir Kigel, editor of the West Coast Russian-language newspaper Da Plus.

	The first, arriving in the 1970s or '80s, "now are well-established as doctors, lawyers, engineers, owners of businesses."

	The religious refugees  Baptists, Pentecostal Christian and historically oppressed Jews  came next, many from Ukraine, Kigel said.

	"Now, since the end of the 1980s, there are about 10,000 Russian technicians, artists and other professionals who are most willing to mingle with Americans and to try to organize trade with Russia," he said.

	Many of them left as the Soviet Union dissolved into chaos in 1991.

HUAC investigation into communist activites in Seattle WA

HUAC appears to be mucking with or gathering information on an FBI investigation


interesting that in Davis file, FBI seemed to report on HUAC investigations (why would they need an informant for that?)


Mr. Dennet says Communists accused him of being an FBI agent, appears to be trying to cover for himself. A bit backwards.


Stenhouse was communist, active

board of Dunham's school and President of Church

"He was past president of the Eastshore Unitarian Church and the Mercer Island School Board and was an organizer for the Group Health Cooperative."

1955 article on Stenhouse's communism, but behind paywall



https://books.google.com/books?id=ivy8OziEHJ8C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7
	Mercer Island High school itself was anything but ordinary. The year before Stanley Ann enrolled there, John Stenhouse, then chairman of Mercer Island School Board, testified before the House of Un-American Activities Committee that he had been a member of the Communist Party. At the same time, teacher like Jim Wicherman and Val Foubert routinely ruffled feathers by challenging their studends to question authority and societal norms. While the English teacher Foubert assigned such controversial texts as Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, William Golding's Lord of writings on homosexuality, philosophy teacher Wichterman led classroom discussion on Camus, Sartre, Kierkegaard, and Karl Marx. The hallway connecting Foubert's and Wichterman's classrooms was dubbed "Anarchy Alley."

	"I had them read the Communist Manifestor," Whichterman recalled, "and the parents went nuts. They didn't want any dicussion about sex, religion, or politics." As for Stanley Ann, Wichterman remembered that "she'd question anything: What's so good about democracy? What's so good about capitalism? What's wrong with communism? She had an inquiring mind." Fellow student Jill Burton-Dascher agreed: "Stannie was intellectually way more mature than we were an a little bit ahead of time, in an off center way."

	The Dunham's were not part of the inevitable campaign to have Wichterman and Foubert fired.

	...By the time Stanley Ann was sixteen, the family was attending Sunday services at the East Shore Unitarian Church in Bellevue. At the height of the McCarthy era, its congregation was so outspokenly left-leaning that East Shore Unitarian soon became known throughout the region as "the Little Red Church on the Hill."


interesting that book says Ann wanted to go to University of Chicago and not Universty of Washington like the Obama tome says. Why such a big discrepency between these two books? This one seems more like misinformation.

what is this



http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv56692
	Hazel Anna Wolf (1898 - 2000) was a prominent Seattle activist who fought for feminism, human rights, labor and environmental protection throughout her 101 years.

	...She moved to Seattle in 1923 as a struggling single mother and became interested in labor issues. She was a member of the Communist Party from the 1930s into the 1940s, and was active in immigration issues, at one point nearly being deported to her native Canada. By the time of McCarthyism, she was being targeted by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service as a subversive foreign national. Her deportation cases lasted from 1949-1963, and, though she later became a U.S. citizen, she never made any apologies for her Communist affiliation.

	...She was inspired by the Sandinista's connection between environmental stewardship and democratic socialism.

	History of East Shore 

	...In September, 1981, Dr. Leon Hopper left his position as Director for Ministerial Education of the Unitarian Universalist Association in Boston to become East Shore’s fourth senior minister. Each minister had brought a different style and different strengths to the growing congregation, and Dr. Hopper began pulling all the strands together by encouraging the members to determine East Shore’s mission, its goals, and the steps to reach those goals.


http://www.freedomtoquestion.org/supplemental_materials/2003_ga_youth_leadership_panel.htm
	Speaker: Leon Hopper

	I was active in the American Unitarian Youth from 1946 to 1952, serving two years as president of the AUY.

	...It is not difficult for me to say that my life has been shaped and formed by my experience in this denomination's youth organization. I would not have entered the ministry had it not been for the AUY and my experience in it. I would not have learned about organizations, community development, social outreach, personal leadership, had it not been for the experiences that I had had in our denomination's youth movement.


https://books.google.com/books?id=OqSKTwsSk6AC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71
	American Unitarian Youth's affiliation with the World Federation of Democratic Youth met with a challenge at the 1947 AUY convention. ...A strong minority had opposed affiliation at the previous year's convention, citing WFDY's communist participants.

	...A last straw for many AUY leaders had been the purging of the only noncommunist member of WFDY's Secretariat. AUY wrote a letter condemning the move. By the time the affiliation question came to the 1948 annual meeting in Oklahoma for a vote, AUY, UYF, and the American Youth for a Free World were the only American affiliates WFDY had left.

	...the convention voted to disaffiliate. AUY Council members Pete Riable, Leon Hopper, Kurt Hanslow, and Louise Gartner were among those appointed to a committee for writing up a statement explaining the decision.

	...The Unitarian Service Committee was caught up in a communist controversy of its own, and many churches and denominations were touched by the beginnings of what would develop into the witch hunts of the McCarthy era.


http://www.freedomtoquestion.org/supplemental_materials/2003_ga_youth_leadership_panel.htm
	...one of the other features that to me that was very important was our sense of global outreach in the youth movement. When I went to my first convention, the discussion was permeated with the question of whether the AUY could continue to participate in the World Federation of Democratic Youth, or whether we should withdraw from an organization that was supposedly a Communist front

	...In February 2016 Sergey Pospelov, a former head of the state-run Russian youth organisation, Rossmolodezh was at a meeting with Nicolas Papademetriou, president of the “World Federation of Democratic Youth”. The WFDY has been described as a continuation of the Soviet-era Young Communist International, which was affiliated with Comintern. In the mid 20th century WFDY was headed by Alexander Shelepin, who subsequently became the head of the KGB.

	Organizers of the Festivals: The International Union of Students and the World Federation of Democratic Youth

	Of the many techniques which international Communism has employed since the Second World War, one of the most effective has been the organization of Communist "front" groups, so called because they solicit mass membership with constructive programs, but actually "front" for Soviet propaganda. In many cases, these front groups are also used as centers for recruitment and training of young leaders, for espionage, and even for revolutionary resistance to existing governments. Some, like the World Peace Council, encompass a wide range of group interests. Others, like the World Federation of Trade Unions or the International Organization of Journalists, have a particular target for their appeals. The International Union of Students (IUS) and the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) belong to the second group. It is they who represent the international Communist movement on the youth and student front

	"FRONT" ORGANIZATIONS IN FEVER

	The various international "front" organizations controlled by Communists have been badly shaken by Russia's onslaught in Hungary. Their Soviet masters have tried to get the "fronts" to concentrate exclusively on Egypt, but have failed. The whole elaborate structure patiently built up in Stalin's time now seems endangered. If it gives way, a huge gap will be torn in Moscow's propaganda network.

	The principle on which the "fronts" were constructed was that (a) ultimate control must always remain safely in Communist hands, but (b) gullible non-Communists must be drawn in in sufficient numbers to mask the organizations' real nature. These principles apply to the World Federation of Democratic Youth


http://www.freedomtoquestion.org/supplemental_materials/2003_ga_youth_leadership_panel.htm
	...the discussion was permeated with the question of whether the AUY could continue to participate in the World Federation of Democratic Youth, or whether we should withdraw from an organization that was supposedly a Communist front, to participate in the World Assembly of Youth.

	...'The United Nations first World Assembly of Youth that Butler raised $225,000 to help stage last month in New York was called "a circus" by one of its participants, on a Stop in Chicago last week.

	Ariel Whine, 26, who represented Israel at the two-week assembly, called it "a gross distortion of the U. N. General Assembly. T h e communists dominated the sessions and nothing at all was achieved but political propagandizing. 


http://www.freedomtoquestion.org/supplemental_materials/2003_ga_youth_leadership_panel.htm
	...The issue was not what to do. The matter was that we were focused beyond our own continent, to a different continent.

	...the international and global outreach for the program, and I believe that that's even more important in the days that we face today. If we are to help our youth move into a world which is a global reality we need an opportunity to provide them with that contact and that outreach. That's my experience and my reflection, and I thank you for the opportunity.

EMOTIONS AND FACTS 

Apparently the Junior High P-TA 
Board accepted without challenge 
pr. Costigan as a possible speaker, 
and even concurred when his date 
was established by the program 
chairman. It remains the right of 
the principal, however, to oppose 
any program to be presented in 
the school system. It seems sub- 
sequently that this opposition was 
a majority .conclusion of the P-TA 
board also. 

lit must have come to the atten- 
tion of one or several members of 
the hoard that Dr. Costigan was 
involved in some way with several 
organizations which have been un- 
der investigation by the Attorney- 
General for subservise activities. 
v- The Attorney-General's list is pub- 
i lie domain and can be obtained 
J from Seattle Public Library, his- 
l tory department on the first floor. 
Dr. Costigan was in 1956 a board 
member of one organization at least 
which has been questioned by four 
separate government agencies, and 
he was ' a committee member of 
that, organization as late as 1959, 
Without drawing conclusion the 
P-TA decided "against his a pear- 
ance with P-TA sanction or school 
sponsorship, Certainly the speaker 
himself and the movie he has dis- 
cussed may be seen and heard at 
any one of a number of other 
places. 
CoH ^f i miw - the film "Operation. 



Abolition" which has received pub- 
lic smears, again the facts of the 
hearings may be clearly known -by 
any citizen in a pamphlet entitled 
"Communist Target— Youth*', sut> 
titled "Communist Infiltration and 
Agitation Tactics." The booklet is 
a report by J. Edgar Hoover in 
which he undeniably proves that 
the riots in San Francisco were 
engineered and fostered by the 
Communist Party. (Booklet 57964 
issued by the U.S. Government 
Printing Office.) This should be 
read in its entirety by every 
American citizen. 

If we permit ourselves to be 
divided over issues on which, we 
are half informed, we are destin- 
ing our right to democracy^ Sho Id 
we not then open our minds o 
many opinions and issues and ;W 
sticking, our emotions in cold 
storage? 

fiercer Island has a school sys- 
tem of outstanding calibre and per- 
haps we should .all give some 
thought to the position in which 
Mr. Murray and the P-TA hoard 
were placed. We are fallible, and 
we are willing to admit it. The 
enemies of democracy would like 
nothing better than to see us in a 
turmoil over nothing in particular 
until our minds are too befuddled 
to embrace and live the tenets of 
our way of life.

!" 'COMMUNISM on ■ th« 
lap' comes out of the firsf 
hapter of the Blue Book o, 
le John Birch Society— th 
most dangerous , .fascist or 3 
ganization in the United 
States," MacDonald charged. 
He was first to take the ros- 
trum. - 

"This is. the same organi- 
zation; that called President 
Eisenhower a traitor and 
Allen Dulles a Communist," 
MacDonald added. 

, "The .message of discon? 
tent which the film sows is 
. that 'ydu can't trust any-' 
one'," the attorney said. 

The John Birch Society, 
founded in 1958, is named 
after a Baptist minister 
killed in China . during the 
Second World War. 

"OPERATION Abolition" 
takes parts of what occurred 
during three days of trouble 
in San Francisco during a 
hearing of the House Un- 
American Activities Com- 
mittee and places the inci- 
dents, where they are most 
effective^ MacDonald stated, 

MacDonald said the stu- 
dents involved' in the 'San 
Francisco riots' were or- 
derly, and were merely try- 
ing to get in to hear the tes- 
timony before the House 
committee. , 

v Several instances of police 
brutality during the riots are 
not shown on the fjlm, the 
speaker said. 

f'OF THE 64 students ar| 

listed, 63 have been ad 
qjuitted by the courts, ' an| 
the judge stated he did not 
believe the riots were- Com- 
munist-inspired, " MacDon- 
ald said. 

"During the 'riots/, the 
boys and girls sat down be- 
~pre police ever turned the 
Dses on them. The film 
bes not' show this," the at- 
torney said. - 

As MacDonald sat down, a 
man approached the Rev. 
Matthew P. Bigliardi,, mod- 
erator, and said he was a 
voluntary organizer for the 
John Birch Society. 

The unidentified-man said 
MacDonald had no right to 
criticize the society, and Mr.. 



Bigliardi had.no right to let 
him speak. ~ ^ 
The spectator was ignored 
and the incident passed, 

MRS. SHAKELFORD, fol- 
lowing MacDonald to the 
platform, denied that the 
films are distorted. 

"The scenes are > not in 
'sequence — they wander 
through three 'areas of 
thought,' " she said. "They 
cover three days of rioting 
in 45 minutes of film."'' 

"Mr. MacDonald should 
recall that the students in 
Hungary didn't face fire 
hoses— they- faced guns and 
tanks. *■■-..' 

"The judge ^ho tried the 
63. students has said' he did 
believe the' riots, were Com- 
munist-inspired. 

"And of the 63 students,. 
39 are not newcomers to riot- 
ing-^prior to and after the 
San Francisco event they 
have been involved in other 
demonstrations," Mrs, Shak- 
elford added, 

"I PREFER TO BELIEVE

inspired by the Communists. 
"Students have a right ti

"There was no police bru*

"Since 1945, the Commit

letter to Mercer reporter by MacDonald on alleged smear campaign by Lawrence Timbers against Dr. Giovanni Costigan, said to have lead to cancelling a Mercer High PTA meeting since Costigan was going to speak there.

MacDonald sounds indignant, supports communists in Spanish civil war

says Charles Murray decided to cancel having him there

MacDonald thinks you should be outraged.


	Letters to the Editor
	Mercer Island Reporter
	Rainier Avenue
	Seattle Washington

	Dear Sir,

	The last issue of the Mercer Island Reporter carried a brief news story that Mr. and Mrs. Fauchald, presidents of the Mercer island Junior High School PTA, had announced that the PTA meeting scheduled for February 27, 1961, had been cancelled. Not stated was the fact that Dr. Giovanni Costigan had been scheduled to speak at the meeting.

	Unusual circumstances surround the cancellation of the meeting, circumstances which should be known to residents of Mercer Island.

	...Upon request from Mr. Fauchald, the school principal then passed out to each in attendance a copy of a fact sheet on Dr. Costigan prepared by one Lawrence Timbers, Chairman, State Anti-Subversive Committee ...The fact sheet asserted that Dr. Costigan had been a member of the American Civil Liberties Union for many years, had made a speech in 1939 before a meeting raising funds for the Abraham Lincoln brigade (a brigade of Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War against fascism)


https://books.google.com/books?id=wVndU5P4V-8C
	The beginning of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 opened up a major new field of operations for Serebryansky’s Administration for Special Tasks and for INO as a whole. The struggle of the Spanish republican government to defend itself against the nationalist rebellion led by General Francisco Franco fired the imagination of the whole of the European left as a crusade against international fascism: 35,000 foreign volunteers, most of them Communist, set out for Spain to join the International Brigades in defense of the republic. In October 1936 Stalin declared in an open letter to Spanish Communists: “Liberation of Spain from the yoke of the Spanish reactionaries is not the private concern of Spaniards alone, but the common cause of all progressive humanity.” From the outset, however, the NKVD was engaged in Spain in a war on two fronts: against Trotskyists within the republicans and the International Brigades, as well as against Franco and the nationalist forces. The former illegal resident in London, Aleksandr Orlov, sent to Spain as legal resident after the outbreak of the Civil War, confidently assured the Centre in October, “The Trotskyist organization POUM [Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista] can be easily liquidated.”

	...Among Vaupshasov’s duties in Spain was the construction and guarding of a secret crematorium which enabled the NKVD to dispose of its victims without leaving any trace of their remains. Many of those selected for liquidation were lured into the building containing the crematorium and killed on the spot.

	...Fisher’s file records that his birth certificate had been obtained by the NKVD in Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War, at a time when it was collecting identity documents from members of the International Brigades for use in illegal operations


https://ia801805.us.archive.org/23/items/foia_Communism_on_Map-Operation_Abolition-Seattle-1/Communism_on_Map-Operation_Abolition-Seattle-1.pdf
	...After the fact sheet has been passed, around, school principal Charles Murray, said that he had heard that Dr. Costigan had spoken at a meeting on Bainbridge Island and had there advocated co-existence and the admission of Red China to the United Nations, Mr. Murray adding, "Mercer Island people don't think that way" and, "Such talk shouldn't be heard on Mercer Island." Mr. Fauchald, although presiding, said several times that he was dead set against having Dr. Costigan speak at the PTA and a motion was made and carried canceling the Costigan invitation.

	...In any event, Dr. Costigan has agreed to speak on Mercer Island February 27, 1961, and at that meeting (at a place to be announced), he will discuss the facts of this incident and the general subject of civil liberties ...All Island resident and friends are invited

	...At the meeting the Timbers fact sheet will be displayed.

	Yours very truly,
	Kenneth A. MacDonald

	Faculty History: Giovanni Costigan and the Red Scare on Campus

	In 1948, History Professor Giovanni Costigan was one of forty UW professors investigated, and eleven subpoenaed to appear before Washington State's Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, more popularly known as the Canwell Commission. Costigan came into the committee's crosshairs for his outspoken support of the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, along with Canwell's personal belief that the professor was a member of the Communist Party.

	After giving his testimony, Costigan was not singled out for further disciplinary action, and emerged from the Canwell Commission relatively unscathed. Three of his colleagues, however, were less fortunate. Ralph Gundlach, Joseph Butterworth and Herbert Phillips were fired by the university after the committee ruled that they had been part of the Communist Party.

	The Canwell Commission was not Costigan's last run-in with the far right. In 1961, the radical anti-Communist John Birch society published a "fact sheet" on the UW professor charging him with, among other things, supporting the Spanish Republic, belonging to the ACLU, and opposing Senator Joseph McCarthy.

	Costigan to Speak MIHS February 27

	Dr. Giovanni Costigan, University of Washington professor, will speak on the general subject of civil liberties at the High School Multipurpose Building at 8:00 February 27.

	Cancellation of Dr. Costigan's speech before the Jr. High PTA was the subject of a letter written by Mr. Kenneth MacDonald and printed in the Reporter two weeks ago. The letter triggered about 100 communications to Mr. MacDonald from Island residents, most of them supporting his stand that the PTA board had acted unwisely.

	...Commenting on his position, Mr MacDonald said, "This is not trivia nor is this a personal attack. As an attorney I spend much of my time defending teachers..."

He once headed the Washington State Board Against Discrimination and helped force the city to allow the African-American singer and activist Paul Robeson to appear at Civic Auditorium.

	...Mr. MacDonald was an isolationist at the start of World War II, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor changed that.

	...most famously, Mr. MacDonald helped clients hauled before tribunals such as the House Un-American Activities Committee, set on hunting down Communists.

	Mercer Island Crowd Sees Debated Films

	Mercer Island turned out en masse last night to see a double-bill showing of "Communism on the Map" and "Operation Abolition."

	Teen-agers were particularly numerous in the overflow crowd that filled every seat and lined the walls of the Mercer Island High School auditorium.

	Five deputy sheriffs were stationed about the auditorium, but their services were never needed.

	BEFORE THE SHOWING of the controversial films, Mrs. Virginia Shakelford of Tacoma spoke for 15 minutes on the value of the films and the dangers of Communism pointed out in the films.

	Kenneth A. MacDonald, Seattle attorney who was given equal time, described the films as a "distortion of fact" and a piece of propaganda that shows the political beliefs of the sponsors rather than a true picture of a period of history.

	..."'Communism on the Map' comes out of the first chapter of the Blue Book of the John Birch Society--the most dangerous fascist organization in the United States,' MacDonald charged.

	..."The message of discontent which the film sows is that 'you can't trust anyone'," the attorney said.

	..."OPERATION Abolition" takes parts of what occurred during three days of trouble in San Francisco during a hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee and places the incidents where they are most effective, MacDonald stated.

	MacDonald said the students involved in the 'San Francisco riots' were orderly, and were merely trying to get in to hear the testimony before the House committee.

	Several instances of police brutality during the riots are not shown on the film, the speaker said.

	"OF THE 64 students arrested, 63 have been acquitted by the courts, and the judge stated he did not believe the riots were Communist-inspired," MacDonald said.

	"During the 'riots,' the boys and girls sat down before police ever turned the hoses on them. The film does not show this," the attorney said.


https://books.google.com/books?id=uPZXEkMA0qQC&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55
	On the morning of May 13, the second day of the hearings, 200 students lined up to enter the hearing room, and soon those who gained admission began jeering the committee, hissing the questioners, and laughing in the faces of their antagonists. After the noon recess those who had been subpoenaed began chanting, "Open the doors! Open the doors!" in an effort to get more students into the room. A squad of police removed the protesters and restored some semblance of order so that the hearings could proceed. The next day, however, the protesters were back in force. Although the same number were admitted to the proceedings room students took up positions outside of the doors and began signing and chanting. Eventually the noise became too much for the committee which called in the police to clear the demonstrators out of the building. When it became clear that the students would not move, fire hoses were turned on them, and many were either washed or dragged by police officers down the long, slick marble staircase. Outside, nearly 2,000 people watched as students came tumbling out of the building.

	...The demonstrations convinced conservative observers that not only were subversives still active in the United States but that contemplating shutting down the one legislative boy committed to their annihilation was nothing less than preposterous. May 13, or "Black Friday" as some conservatives labeled it, convinced them that playing defensively would not win the game.

	...The result was *Operation Abolition*, a forty-five-minute documentary about the San Francisco hearings produced by HUAC. Assembled from subpoenaed news footage from local television stations, the film combined protest scenes with talking heads from the committee and Congress. After a brief introduction by Fulton Lewis III, a well-known anticommunist and former HUAC staff member, Chairman Walter set the stage for the rest of the film:

		"Operation Abolition": This is what the Communists call their current drive to destroy the House Committee on Un-American Activities, weaken the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to discredit its great director, J. Edgar Hoover, and to render sterile the security laws of our Government. The Communist Party has given top priority to "Operation Abolition" and has assigned agents trained in propaganda and agitation to this project.

	Walter realized that to guarantee HUAC's survival, he had to link Operation Abolition to a better-known agency and individual, and invoking Hoover's name achieved that goal perfectly, a tactic endorsed by Hoover. By Walter's reckoning the Operation Abolition campaign--which he was convinced was CPUSA-organized and -funded and used gullible students to carry out the dirty work--was extremely ambitious; the possibility that it reflected nothing more than an effort by left-leaning (or civil libertarian) Americans with no ties to the Kremlin was never even entertained.

	...Although such connections were difficult to prove, they were also difficult to disprove, and HUAC was certain to exploit any fears such comparisons might raise. How much Walter and his companions believed in the linkages is difficult to ascertain

	...HUAC contracted Washington Video Productions to print hundreds of copies of the film, which were then sent out across the country to both public and private organizations. Eventually some 2,000 prints of the film were in circulation, and by mid-161 one estimate placed the total number of viewers at 15 million, a number rivaling or surpassing many contemporary major Hollywood releases. ...Yet even with the film's overwhelmingly positive reception by the conservative community, the committee was hardly prepared for the controversy that erupted once it began public screenings.

	President Truman’s claim in 1951 that “the greatest asset that the Kremlin has is Senator McCarthy” was, in the long run, to be proved right. McCarthy ultimately did more for the Soviet cause than any agent of influence the KGB ever had. His preposterous self-serving crusade against the “Red Menace” made liberal opinion around the world skeptical of the reality of Moscow’s secret intelligence offensive against the Main Adversary. Even Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed one after the other in the same electric chair at New York’s Sing Sing Prison in 1953, were widely believed to have been framed. It took some years, however, for the Centre to grasp the enormous propaganda advantages of McCarthyism.


https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=768335
	Andrew blames the post-McCarthyism climate in the U.S. for an inhibited understanding of Soviet KGB operations in general. He notes that the alarmist tone and rhetoric in the public prosecution of alleged communists worked to the Soviets’ advantage, and repelled many Americans from this discourse:

		Grasping the extent of the KGB’s ambitions . . . has been complicated by the legacy of McCarthyism. Just as the fraudulent inventions of Senator Joe McCarthy’s self-serving anti-Communist witch-hunt helped to blind liberal opinion to the reality of the unprecedented Soviet intelligence offensive against the United States, so simplistic conspiracy theories of Soviet plans for world conquest made most non-conspiracy theorists skeptical of even realistic assessments of Soviet designs. . . . McCarthy and America’s other anti-Communist conspiracy theorists were, albeit unconsciously, among the KGB’s most successful Cold War agents of influence. Reaction against their risible exaggerations helps to account for the remarkable degree to which the KGB has been left out of Cold War history.

	The spectator was ignored and the incident passed.

	MRS. SHAKELFORD, following MacDonald to the platform, denied that the films are distorted.

	..."Mr. MacDonald should recall that the students in Hungary didn't face fire hoses-they faced guns and tanks."

	"We must be fearful of Communists," she said, citing numerous instances in which former employees of the United States government have moved to and are working in Communist countries.

	THE PEOPLE of America have been brain-washed to a certain extent by the Communists, she warned, and Americans must be ever-vigilant.

	"Educate yourself--teach your children--urge your friends to read--and write your congressman your feelings on controversial issues," Mrs. Shakelford advised the audience.

more on Namkung

	Johsel Namkung, a native and citizen of Korea, was ordered deported from the United States to Korea after an administrative hearing in which it was found that at the time of his entry into the United States he was an alien affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States. 

	...The alien appears to be attacking the district court judgment upon two inconsistent theories: One is that he has the right to a full dress hearing before the Attorney General's hearing officer, together with the hearing officer's decision based solely upon the record made at the hearing. The other theory is that the hearing officer had no right to express his own opinion in his report to the Assistant Commissioner as to the proper decision.

	Mr. Tavenner. What was the name of your friend who was in 
Seattle at the time who would perform this duty of delivery of the 
document to an underground source in South Korea ? 

Mr. SuNOO. His name is Namkung — last name, and Joshel — 
J-o-s-h-e-1. 

Mr. Tavenner. Was such a letter or document prepared ? 

Mr. SuNOO. It was prepared by Reverend Lee, and I was cosigner of 
the letter. 

Mr. Tavenner. Will you state, in a general way, what the purpose 
of this document was ? 

Mr. SuNOo. The main idea was to inform the situation, that is, 
political and economic situation of the United States and suggest that 
what we Communist sympathizers among Koreans here in the United 
States could do for the cause of Korean Communists, particularly in 
the sense of propaganda — that is, "North Korean Government is the 
government of the people and the choice of the people" — in that effect. 


or was about doing propaganda, coordinating with North Korea


Mr. Ta\^nner. "This letter is being written in the belief that it will 
be delivered through a trustworthy messenger, i. e. utilizing the re- 
turn home of comrade Joshel Namkung. This writer transmitted to 
3omrade Kim II Sung for the first time since liberation in April 1947 
the situation of Korean residents on this side of the Pacific, the prog- 
ress of the independence movement, conditions in the United States 
and activities of party comrades, through Dr. Han Hung Su, who re- 
sided in the capital of Czechoslovakia and through representatives; 
who participated in the World Professional League which opened, 
here." 

Now will you tell us more in detail what was meant by that ; that is,, 
what message it was that you sent to the prime minister through Dr. 

tHan who resided in the capital of Czechoslovakia ? 
Mr. SuNOO. Mr. Lee had regular communication in Czechoslovakia. 


...


Mr. Jackson. In the testimony you are about to give before this 
subcommittee, do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God ? 

Mr. Namkung. I do. 

Mr. Tavenner. What is your name, please, sir ? 

Mr. Namkung. My name is Johsel Namkung, J-o-h-s-e-1 N-a-m- 
k-u-n-g. 

Mr. Tavenner. Are you accompanied by counsel ? 

Mr. Namkung. Yes, I am. 

Mr. Tavenner. Will counsel please identify himself for the record ? 

Mr. MacDonald. My name is Kenneth A. MacDonald of Seattle, a 
member of the Seattle Bar Association. 


...

(Witness examines document.) 

Mr. TA\Ti:NNER. Do you see your name alluded to in the first para- 
graph ? 

Mr. Namkung. Yes, I do, sir. 

Mr. Tavenner. It was testified here that the document which you 
liave in your hands, that is, the original in the Korean text, was given 
to you for delivery by you to the underground in South Korea so that 
it in turn might be delivered through underground sources to the 
Prime Minister of North Korea. 
Mr. Namkung. That is correct, Mr. Tavenner. 
Mr. Tavenner. Did that occur '^ 
Mr. Namkung. Tliat is riglit, sir. 

Mr. Tavenner. Will you examine the document sufficiently to de- 
termine whether or not it is an English translation of the document 
which was delivered to you ? 

Mr. Namkung. Mr. Tavenner, I tliink I have seen this document 
once before, 2 or 3 years ago, and I think it is the same document, and 
I cannot determine whether it is an exact correct translation of the 
ori<rinal Korean document, but I think it relates the substantial con- 
tents of the original letter. 

Mr. Tavenner. In any event, the orginal document was delivered 
to you ? 

Mr. Namkung. Tliat is right, sir. 
Mr. Tavenner. "\"\nio delivered it to you? 

Mr. Namkung. Sir, I would like to elaborate on that a little bit. 
Reverend Lee gave me a name of a medical doctor, who was sup- 
posed to be working with South Korean Government in public health 
department. I don't remember his name anymore. However, he 
gave me — jotted that name down on a slip of paper and gave it to me, 
telling me that "If you go to South Korea, go and drop in at the pub- 
lic health department and ask for this person" — there would be doc- 
tor by name of this name. And I went there— I mean the public 
health department. I asked at the information desk whether there 
was a doctor by that name working at that time. The receptionist told 
me that he didn't know any person by that name. So I had known 
several friends — musicians, writers, poets, painters, and all those peo- 
ple of that category who were known to be leftwing— kftwing per- 
sons — and I came across a person by the name of Kim Kong Sok and 
I asked him in a roundabout way whether he had any access to under- 



ground personnel so that I could deliver a letter addressed to the 
Premier of Northern Korean Government, and he said he certainly 
had, so I handed it to him, 

Mr. Tavenner, And that was the manner in which you disposed of 
the document ? 

Mr. Namkung. That is right, sir. 

Mr. Tavenner. Do you know, of your own personal knowledge, 
whether or not the document was delivered to the Prime Minister of 
North Korea ? 

Mr. Namkung. No, sir. I was supposed to get the reply of this 
letter through the same channel, and during my stay in South Korea 
for 4 months, I have seen several times this person Kim Kong Sok 
and inquired of him of the reply and he repeatedly told me that he 
has transmitted the letter but has never received any reply.

	In September 1918, as the Allies pushed back German and Austrian armies, the dreaded Spanish influenza, which had made a brief appearance at U.S. Army bases in the spring, broke out full blown at encampments on the East Coast. Fort Devins in Massachusetts and Fort Dix in New Jersey were particularly hard hit, with stricken soldiers dying daily.

something ressurected the American intervention? I guess it was in Russian propaganda campaign then like article says



http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/spotlights/allies.htm
	In Siberia and elsewhere, the Allied powers dispatched a sufficient number of troops to maintain a show of interest in Russia's fate, but not enough to give the 'Whites' a real chance of victory. Soviet propaganda, nonetheless, portrayed Allied intervention as a conspiracy of international capitalism. 



http://pbma.grobbel.org/aide_memoire.htm
	It is the clear and fixed judgment of the Government of the United States, arrived at after repeated and very searching reconsiderations of the whole situation in Russia, that military intervention there would add to the present sad confusion in Russia rather than cure it, injure her rather than help her, and that it would be of no advantage in the prosecution of our main design, to win the war against Germany.


idiots

	...Military action is admissible in Russia, as the Government of the United States sees the circumstances, only to help the Czecho-Slovaks consolidate their forces and get into successful cooperation with their Slavic kinsmen and to steady any efforts at self government or self defense in which the Russians themselves may be willing to accept assistance. Whether from Vladivostok or from Murmansk and Archangel, the only legitimate object for which American or allied troops can be employed, it submits, is to guard military stores which may subsequently be needed by Russian forces and to render such aid as may be acceptable to the Russians in the organization of their own self-defense.

	U.S. 'MAD MAN'S WAR' FOUGHT ON RUSSIAN SOIL

	...GIOVANNI COSTIGAN Professor Emeritus of History University of Washington Seattle, Feb. 7, 1984

	...To the Editor: 

	...The President appears to have forgotten, or perhaps has never heard of, the Archangel and Vladivostok expeditions of 1918-19, even though Nikita Khrushchev, during his U.S. visit in 1959, reminded Americans of these invasions of Russian soil by United States troops.

	In 1919, more than 5,000 Americans were sent to Archangel to fight in an undeclared war against Russia.


http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MarApril12/Polar_Bear.html
	...the U.S. Army was present in Russia at the end of World War I for several reasons. One was that the massive amounts of military supplies and equipment stockpiled at the Siberian port of Vladivostok and the northern Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangel had to be recovered for retrograde to their countries of origin or distribution to the anti-Bolshevik "White Russian" forces fighting the Bolshevik "Red" army in the Russian Civil War.

	...two other reasons led to American involvement: supporting the movement of the Czech Legion in its attempt to escape from Russia and halting further encroachment of Imperial Japanese forces into the region.

	...Some wishful politicians subsequently hoped that a small Allied military force could stabilize the area long enough for the Russians to create a democratic government and field a viable army.


http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/spotlights/allies.htm
	In Siberia and elsewhere, the Allied powers dispatched a sufficient number of troops to maintain a show of interest in Russia's fate, but not enough to give the 'Whites' a real chance of victory. Soviet propaganda, nonetheless, portrayed Allied intervention as a conspiracy of international capitalism.

	NEW ARCHANGEL PLANS BRING UP FIASCO OF 1918

	AEF Sent to Russia Still Is a Mystery.

	...one of the strangest adventures of the World war--the sending of an American military expedition to that area for 11 months in 1918 and 1919. This cost hundreds of American lives and millions of American dollars and has been described as futile and needless.

	...Not at War with Russia

	...the men who survived the tragic Archangel maneuver could not understand why they were kept there seven months after the armistice

	...Even the prelude to the Archangel venture was tragic. At sea, en route to he port, 500 of the Americans were stricken with the influenza. On landing there was no adequate provision for the sick. Many died.

	...They knew then that their war was not related to the world war and the feeling grew they were fighting for no reason and ere forgotten by the rest of the world.

	...In may, 1919, the "American expeditionary force, North Russia," was ordered to return to America. It did so in June, sailing away with a record of 2,485 casualties.

	BRIDGES PLEDGES AID FOR F.D.R. IN BATTLE "TO DEFEAT NAZISM"

	San Francisco, Cal., Oct 4 [1941]

	Harry Bridges, state CIO director and west coast radical longshoreman's leader, facing deportation as a communist, today pledged full and complete support to President Roosevelt in "the fight to defeat Nazism"

	..."We will follow and support the President in the all-out program to defeat fascism," Bridges said.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Russia_Intervention
	An international policy to support the White Russians and, in Winston Churchill's words, "to strangle at birth the Bolshevik State" became increasingly unpopular in Britain. In January 1919 the Daily Express was echoing public opinion when, paraphrasing Bismarck, it exclaimed, "the frozen plains of Eastern Europe are not worth the bones of a single grenadier".

	From April 1919, the inability to hold the flanks and mutinies in the ranks of the White Russian forces caused the Allies to decide to leave. British officers at Shussuga had a lucky escape when their Russian gunners remained loyal. A number of western military advisers were killed by White mutineers who went over to the Bolsheviks. The Allies were forced to retreat.

	U.S. 'MAD MAN'S WAR' FOUGHT ON RUSSIAN SOIL

	...By 1934, 58 more skeletons had been shipped back to the U.S. Numerous casualties were suffered through frostbite, malnutrition and the great influenza epidemic that the troopships carried from Britain to Archangel.

	...Perhaps the immediate lesson we should learn from that disaster is not to get involved, to quote Cudahy again, in another "shameful illegitimate little war" - this time in Central America - not even in the guise of a crusade against "an empire of evil."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes
	As of 2011, academic consensus has not been achieved on causes of large scale killings by states, including by states governed by communists. In particular, the number of comparative studies suggesting causes is limited. The highest death tolls that have been documented in communist states occurred in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, in the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong, and in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. The estimates of the number of non-combatants killed by these three regimes alone range from a low of 21 million to a high of 70 million.

The main idea was to inform the situation, that is, political and economic situation of the United States and suggest that what we Communist sympathizers among Koreans here in the United States could do for the cause of Korean Communists, particularly in the sense of propaganda — that is, "North Korean Government is the government of the people and the choice of the people" — in that effect.

	Now will you tell us more in detail what was meant by that; that is, what message it was that you sent to the prime minister through Dr. Han who resided in the capital of Czechoslovakia? 

	Mr. SuNOO. Mr. Lee had regular communication in Czechoslovakia. However, I did not have any communication with him.

	Mr. Tavenner. (reading) : In July of the same year a translation copy of "Dialectical Materialism" and a letter were sent through a representative who participated in the World Young Men's Meeting. In September of this year ...a letter was sent to comrade Kim II Sung under the name of four Comrades: Pyon Chun Ho, Kim Kang, Hyun Alice, and myself, Lee Sa Min through comrade Chong Wellington who departed to study in the capital of Czechoslovakia. 

	...Mr. Tavenner. Mr. Chairman, Alice Hyun was the subject of investigation by this committee in Hawaii in 1950 and is the subject of a committee report — not the sole subject of the report, but there is quite extensive evidence that the committee has collected in regard to her activities in Hawaii.  

	...

	Mr. Tavenner. Who delivered it to you? 

	Mr. Namkung. Sir, I would like to elaborate on that a little bit. Reverend Lee gave me a name of a medical doctor, who was supposed to be working with South Korean Government in public health department. I don't remember his name anymore.

	Mr. Tavenner, And that was the manner in which you disposed of the document? 

	Mr. Namkung. That is right, sir.




	Mr. Tavenner. What method was used to transmit this document 
to the Prime Minister of Korea, North Korea ? 

Mr. SuNOO. We had tried to send through mail. We knew that it 
would be very dangerous and difficult, if not impossible. At the time 
we had Korean friend in Seattle who was going to go to Korea, South 
Korea, that is, to get his children over to United States — his wife was 
here ; and he was willing to take the message, the letter. We gave it 
to him. 

Mr. Tavenner. Was it the intention that this document should be 
delivered to underground sources in South Korea for delivery eventu- 
ally in North Korea ? 

Mr. SuNOO. We knew that there were underground movement be- 
tween North and South Korea and we also were convinced if we give 
this letter to underground agent in South it would go to the hands 
of North Korea, and get reply back when he returns back here. We 
had that assurance — not in the absolute sense, but we believed it could 
be done. 

Mr. Tavenner. What was the name of your friend who was in 
Seattle at the time who would perform this duty of delivery of the 
document to an underground source in South Korea ? 

Mr. SuNOO. His name is Namkung — last name, and Joshel —

	Takara confirmed that Davis was a significant influence over Obama during 
the three or four years that he attended the Punahou prep school. These would 
have been the years 1975-1979. She said Obama had been introduced to Davis by 
his grandfather, Stanley Dunham, who considered Davis a "strong black male 
figure" and thought he exerted a "positive" influence over the young man in his 
high-school years. "His grandfather was one of Frank's closest friends," she said. 
"They played chess or cards together."

	Dunham gravitated toward an intellectual clique. According to former classmate Chip Wall, she caught foreign films at Seattle’s only art-house theater, the Ridgemont, and trekked to University District coffee shops like the Encore to talk about jazz, the value of learning from other cultures and the “very dull Eisenhower-ness of our parents.”

	Stanley the father went on to have a checkered career in the furniture trade, but was relatively liberal in his views, and supportive of his strong-minded daughter and his grandson, whom he helped to raise. Madelyn, perhaps more intelligent than her husband, and certainly more practical, became the first woman vice-president of a local bank in Hawaii.



dreams from my father

pg 13

	And that’s where the story might have stopped: a home, a family, a respectable life. Except something must have still
been gnawing at my grandfather’s heart. I can imagine him standing at the edge of the Pacific, his hair prematurely
gray, his tall, lanky frame bulkier now, looking out at the horizon until he could see it curve and still smelling, deep in
his nostrils, the oil rigs and corn husks and hard-bitten lives that he thought he had left far behind. So that when the
manager of the furniture company where he worked happened to mention that a new store was about to open in
Honolulu, that business prospects seemed limitless there, what with statehood right around the corner, he would rush
home that same day and talk my grandmother into selling their house and packing up yet again, to embark on the final
leg of their journey, west, toward the setting sun….

	He would always be like that, my grandfather, always searching for that new start, always running away from the
familiar. By the time the family arrived in Hawaii, his character would have been fully formed, I think-the generosity
and eagerness to please, the awkward mix of sophistication and provincialism, the rawness of emotion that could make
him at once tactless and easily bruised. His was an American character, one typical of men of his generation, men who
embraced the notion of freedom and individualism and the open road without always knowing its price, and whose
enthusiasms could as easily lead to the cowardice of McCarthyism as to the heroics of World War II. Men who were
both dangerous and promising precisely because of their fundamental innocence; men prone, in the end, to
disappointment.

	In 1960, though, my grandfather had not yet been tested; the disappointments would come later, and even then they
would come slowly, without the violence that might have changed him, for better or worse. In the back of his mind he
had come to consider himself as something of a freethinker-bohemian, even. He wrote poetry on occasion, listened to
jazz, counted a number of Jews he’d met in the furniture business as his closest friends. In his only skirmish into
organized religion, he would enroll the family in the local Unitarian Universalist congregation; he liked the idea that
Unitarians drew on the scriptures of all the great religions (“It’s like you get five religions in one,” he would say). Toot
would eventually dissuade him of his views on the church (“For Christ’s sake, Stanley, religion’s not supposed to be
like buying breakfast cereal!”), but if my grandmother was more skeptical by nature, and disagreed with Gramps on
some of his more outlandish notions, her own stubborn independence, her own insistence on thinking something
through for herself, generally brought them into rough alignment.

	All this marked them as vaguely liberal, although their ideas would never congeal into anything like a firm ideology;
in this, too, they were American.


so... communist?



	And so, when my mother came home one day and mentioned a friend she had met at
the University of Hawaii, an African student named Barack, their first impulse was to invite him over for dinner. The
poor kid’s probably lonely, Gramps would have thought, so far away from home. Better take a look at him, Toot would
have said to herself. When my father arrived at the door


did this even happen?

	SEATTLE, Aug. 22— Christopher John Boyce was arrested near here last night after a 19-month international manhunt, and investigators said today that the escaped spy for the Soviet Union might have committed up to 16 bank robberies in recent months. 

	...He had been serving a 40-year sentence for selling information about Central Intelligence Agency espionage satellites to the Soviet Union. He obtained the data while serving as a communications clerk for the TRW Systems Group, which makes such satellites for the intelligence agency. A boyhood friend, Andrew Daulton Lee, 29, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the espionage scheme.

	The charges against Smith have renewed concern about Soviet espionage activity and have shocked his family, former employers, and friends, who describe Smith as a religious man who loved his wife and four children and who, in the words of Julie Monson, wife of Utah's lieutenant governor, "fits the mold we operate in in Salt Lake City."


	...Early this year, Smith decided to move to Washington state, where his parents lived in Bellevue, a suburb of Seattle, his friend recalled.

	In May 1939, FBI executive Ed Tamm suggested to Director J. Edgar Hoover that it was important to prevent sabotage at the Boeing Plant in Seattle, which was producing planes for the U.S. Army. Tamm also proposed that an agent should be exclusively assigned to investigate espionage, counter-espionage, and sabotage cases in Seattle and in several other key Bureau divisions.

	This work expanded quickly. In January 1940, Seattle reported that it was handling five national security-related investigations, including two espionage cases. Of particular concern was the espionage activity being conducted by Japanese nationals ostensibly studying the English language on the West Coast. The key role of Manhattan Project researchers at the nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington—part of America’s effort to develop an atomic bomb—was also a concern, leading to a significant increase in the number of agents assigned to the Seattle Division and its Richland Resident Agency. The work of these agents continued after the war as the arms race began to heat up. By 1945, the division was handling hundreds of national security cases, including ones related to the Boeing Company, the Navy Yard, the Hanford Nuclear Reactor, and the entire coast line, which was considered a target for possible attacks.

	During World War II and into the early years of the Cold War, the FBI was conducting background checks on U.S. government employees involved in atomic energy, working in defense plants, and holding other sensitive positions, leading to additional work and leads for the Seattle Division. In 1946, Seattle’s ongoing counterespionage work paid off when agents arrested Nicholas Redin, a Soviet purchasing commission agent.

	Terrorism by Mail

	An attempt at long-range murder on a grand , of Government officials and prominent citizens was discovered last week. On Tuesday, in Atlanta, the wife of Thomas W. Hardwick, former United States Senator from Georgia, was severely burned and a woman servant was mutilated by the explosion of a small parcel which came thru the mails. The occurrence seemed without possible explanation, until it was discovered two days later that it was only one of an indefinite number of similar happenings--the others, however, without evil results--in all parts of the country.

	...There were sixteen of the parcels found in the New York post office. They were addrest to the Postmaster General, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Solicitor General, the Chief of the Bureau of Immigration, and Mr. Justice Holmes, of the Supreme Court, all at Washington; the mayor and police commissioner of Ne York, the Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York, the Governor and the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, John D. Rockefelelr and J. Pierpont Morgan, and William W. Wood, president of the American Woolen Company.

	All of the addresses of the bombs were either men of wealth or officials who have been active in in restraining the activities of I.W.W., Bolshevik and violently socialistic agitators, or who have favored the restriction of immigration or an internationalism of the terroristic or "Red" type.


http://www.historylink.org/File/11106
	The end of World War I in November 1918 did not bring the peace that so many hoped for. As 1919 dawned, revolutions were ongoing in Europe and insurrections were igniting elsewhere, while in the United States tensions between management and labor were boiling. In numerous American cities that year strikes large and small broke out, some of which became violent and ended with fatalities. At the same time, communist-leaning anarchists, many of whom were believed to be associated with the radical labor union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) wreaked havoc by planting and mailing dozens of bombs throughout the country. Fear of communism, often called Bolshevism in 1919, brought on a "Red Scare" that was every bit as intense in 1919 America as it was during the more well-known McCarthy era of the early 1950s.

	It was against this increasingly paranoid backdrop that America's first general strike took place in February 1919 in Seattle.


http://literarytrebuchet.blogspot.com/2016/07/10-infamous-exploits-of-iww.html
	Seattle General Strike 

	On January 21, 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers in Seattle struck for shorter hours and higher wages. Citing a broken contract with the Emergency Fleet Corporation, Director General Charles Piez flatly refused to negotiate with the striking shipyard workers. That evening, the Seattle Central Labor Council agreed to conduct a general strike throughout the city in order to force a victory for the shipyard workers.  Local unions associated with the more conservative AFL similarly agreed to strike. This, the first general strike in American history, paralyzed the economic life of Seattle. By February 6th, when an additional 60,000 workers struck, schools, businesses, and public services came to a halt. That same day, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a cartoon entitled “Not in a Thousand Years” that showed the red banner of socialism flying above the American flag. 


http://www.historylink.org/File/11106
	It fizzled out after five days, and a new hero arose: Mayor Ole Hanson, a former realtor who had been elected mayor the preceding March. During the strike he threatened to impose martial law (he actually didn't have the authority), issued a proclamation declaring that "the anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs", and called more than a thousand army troops from Camp Lewis (later named Fort Lewis) into the city. Though the strike likely would have failed without his intervention, many nonetheless saw his aggressive posturing as stopping a Bolshevik revolution in its tracks. Near-universal praise from across the country swept into Seattle, but the attention also apparently made Hanson the target of a determined group of radicals.

	Upside Down

	On April 28, 1919, Hanson was in Colorado on a Victory Liberty Loan speaking tour, part of the country's final effort to sell bonds to cover the costs of World War I. That morning, an innocuous-looking package bearing the return address of Gimbel Brothers, a department store in New York City, arrived in the mayor's office. Hanson's regular secretary, G. A. Conklin, was with the mayor, and M. H. Strouse, chief clerk in the city's building department, had been drafted as the mayor's acting secretary. Strouse opened the package's wrapper and found a small box; opening that, he found a roughly six-inch-long, inch-and-a-half-diameter wooden tube with a cap on the end. He casually attempted to open the cap, but it stuck. Holding the tube cap-end down, he gave it a firmer tug and the cap broke. Liquid (some type of acid, though accounts of what type differ) streamed out and stung his hand. The startled Strouse saw several percussion caps and a small glass vial inside the tube and realized it might be a bomb, though at first he also thought it might be a joke.

	Strouse was fortunate. He opened the wooden tube upside down, and the bomb failed to explode. It turned out that the wooden container was designed so the glass vial could not be removed without breaking it. Had Strouse been holding the tube right-side up when the vial broke, the acid would have flowed down the tube onto three percussion caps, exploding the caps and the powdered dynamite packed below.

	The police were called. Word quickly spread and rumors flew even faster. The Seattle Times reported that the police had been notified of a sinister-sounding conversation overheard on a streetcar that the mayor would soon be "got" ("Chemists ..."). But the streetcar gossip only got part of the story. The plot wasn't against just Seattle's mayor. It was nationwide.

	36 Bombs

	The next day a bomb arrived at the Georgia home of former U.S. Senator Thomas Hardwick (1872-1944). The senator was out, but his wife and the family maid were home. Maude Hardwick opened the package but couldn't open the wooden tube inside it. She asked the maid to open the tube. The maid used a knife to force its top off, and when she did, the bomb exploded. The maid lost both of her hands and Mrs. Hardwick was also injured, though not as seriously.

	Late that night an alert postal employee in New York City, Charles Caplan, read a newspaper account about the Hardwick bomb and the details of the package it was sent in. He realized he had 16 similar packages being held for insufficient postage in the parcel-postage storage room at the 30th Street and 8th Avenue post office. Warnings went out to every post office in the United States and Canada. More packages were found and some were intercepted. A few arrived at their destinations, but by this time the recipients knew better than to open them.

	At least 36 bombs were eventually discovered, believed by authorities to have been the work of anarchists associated with the IWW as part of a strategy to wage "class war."


http://literarytrebuchet.blogspot.com/2016/07/10-infamous-exploits-of-iww.html
	According to FBI documents that were released later, the Bureau of Investigation (the former name of the FBI) had suspected something akin to Seattle’s general strike for four years. In 1915, BI agents concluded that because the IWW “catered” to Seattle’s large population of unemployed waterfront workers, a “direct action” strike was likely. When the strike did come, the BI, along with the American media, played up the IWW’s role in prolonging the strike and the deprivations that the strike caused. ...When the strike was quelled, Seattle police arrested hundreds of strikers (some of whom were IWW members) and thoroughly dismantled the commune that the strikers had set up in the city.


https://books.google.com/books?id=Fo1jblFR3BcC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134
	On the same day that the strike was terminated, Special Agents Robert P. Collins and Walter H. Thayer, assisted by police officer A. H. Petri, raided the IWW Propaganda Committee and confiscated two large boxes of IWW literature together with the organization's letters, minute books and other records and brought the acting secretary, James J. Extel, in for questioning. On the following day, the two federal agents accompanied by members of the Sheriff's office raided the IWW Defense Committee on Pacific BLock and took into custody 26 IWW members.


https://books.google.com/books?id=2B1jmnXyZ4wC&pg=PA335&lpg=PA335
	The Bureau had waited until the strike was over, knowing that any federal action was bound to make the workers dig in their heels, and that the strike was about to fail anyway. But the agents had been watching the Wobblies on the West Coast since 1915, as indeed had various local authorities and other federal agencies. During the war, the Justice Department had been forced to send a special assistant, CLarence L. Reames, to stop a wave of illegal arrests of radicals by local authorities and patriotic groups, but he had then joined the Bureau of Immigration and local businessmen in planning the detention of some 3-5,000 suspected alien IWW members in internment camps for future deportation.

	I.W.W. Deportation Cases
	By United States. Congress. House. Committee on Immigration and Naturalization

	...an alien, who at the time of his arrest at Seattle, was the secretary and active head of the Union of Russian Workers in that section of the country. ...He returned to Seattle and immediately resumed his connections with that same organization, also joining the I.W.W. organization.

	...Alien stated further that there are about 20 members of the union; there were 60 or 70 before the Russian revolution, and many of the members have gone to Russia. He admitted his active participation in the affairs of the Russian Workers' Union.

	Alien claims he was a refugee when he entered this country, having been compelled to flee from Russia under an assumed name because he had been engaged in distributing revolutionary literature.

	...Kazis Maskalunas. Arrested at Seattle January 31, 1918, on the ground advocating or teaching anarchy, and ordered deported to Russia at Government expense;

	...Aaron Slutzker. Arrested at Seattle November 28, 1917, on the ground, advocating or teaching anarchy. By decision of September 28, 1919, was ordered deported to Russia at Government expense when possible

	...Charles Bernat, aged 39, single, native and subject of Russia, entered without inspection, presumably at Tacoma, Wash., in 1902 ...The evidence is clear in this case that the above-named alien has be his acts aided and supported the doctrine of sabotage as taught by the I.W.W. It is therefore recommended that he be deported to Russia, at Government expense, when possible, on the ground that he has been found advocating and teaching the unlawful destruction of property.

	...The doctrine and practices of the order, as disclosed by the attached literature, may be indicated by short excerpts from The I.W.W.: Its History, Structure, and Methods, by Vincent St. John and others.

	"As a revolutionary organization, the Industrial Workers of the World aims to use any and all tactics that will get the results sought, with the least expenditure of time and energy. The tactics used are determined solely by the power of the organization to make good in their use. The question of 'right' and 'wrong' does not concern us.

	"It aims, where strikes are used, to paralyze all branches of the industry involved, when the employers can least afford a cessation of work--during the busy season and when there are rush orders to be filled.

	"Failing to force concessions from the employers by the strike, work is resumed and sabotage is used to force the employers to concede to the demands of the workers."

	Sabotage is defined by several I.W.W. writers.

	The new Unionism, by Andre Tridon: "We may distinguish three forms of sabotage. (1) Active sabotage which consists in the damaging of goods or machinery. (2) Obstructionism or passive sabotage which consists in carrying out orders literally, regardless of consequences."

	The Voix du Peuple: "The first thing to do before going out on strike is to cripple all the machinery. * * * Are bakery workers planning to go on strike? Let them pour in the ovens a few pints of petroleum or any other greasy or pungent matter. After that soldiers or scabs may come and bake bread. The smell will not come out of the tiles for three months. Is a strike in sight in steel mills? Pour sand or emery into the oil cups."

	...Sabotage: It's History, Philosophy, and Function, by Walker C. Smith: "Sabotage is a direct application of the idea that property has no rights that its creators are bound to respect. * * * The question is not, Is Sabotage Immoral? but, Does Sabotage get the goods? * * * A bar of soap in the boiler would keep the soldiers at home or else force them to march to the strike. ...Sabotage is discredited by those who believe in property rights. It is the weapon of those who no longer reverence the thing that fetters them. Its advocacy and use helps to destroy the 'property illusion.' The parasites who have property, oppose sabotage, while the producers who have poverty, are commencing to yield that potent weapon."

	...All of the books from which excerpts have been made are either published, sold, or distributed by the I.W.W. Publishing Co. Attention is invited to that part of the testimony of Mr. Dougherty, the alien's witness, in which he states that sabotage might be termed "the conscious withdrawal of efficiency, the slowing up in production, and a refusal to produce in quantity," or that "it might take the form of putting out a poor quality of work." The bureau contends that this is sabotage in its most insidious form, and that for a man to consciously withdraw his efficiency and turn out work of an inferior or defective quality might not only be the direct cause of destruction of property but also destruction of human lives.

	In the early years of World War I, as many as 1,000 American horses per day were shipped off to Europe to assist in the Allied war effort, even though the United States was officially neutral. Those horses became the target of germ warfare, infected with anthrax cultures on American soil; at the same time, mysterious explosions were rocking U.S. munitions factories, and fires were breaking out on ships headed to Europe.

	Journalist Howard Blum says this was all part of an aggressive campaign of spying and sabotage the German government unleashed on the United States soon after war broke out in Europe.

	...How good were these sources? Consider what Steele would write in the memos he filed with Simpson: Source A—to use the careful nomenclature of his dossier—was “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure.” Source B was “a former top level intelligence officer still active in the Kremlin.” And both of these insiders, after “speaking to a trusted compatriot,” would claim that the Kremlin had spent years getting its hooks into Donald Trump.

	Source E was “an ethnic Russian” and “close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump.”

	This individual proved to be a treasure trove of information.

	...Commenting on the negative media publicity surrounding alleged Russian interference in the US election campaign in support of TRUMP, Source E said he understood that the Republican candidate and his team were relatively relaxed about this because it deflected media and the Democrats' attention away from TRUMP's business dealings in China and other emerging markets.

This was managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate’s campaign manager, Paul MANAFORT, who was using foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE, and others as intermediaries.

	A top Trump adviser, Sam Clovis, then employed what campaign aides now acknowledge was their go-to vetting process — a quick Google search — to check out the newcomer.

	...Page was in. 

	He joined a new Trump campaign national security advisory group, and in late March 2016, the candidate pointed to Page, among others, as evidence of a foreign policy team with gravitas.

	But what the Google search had not shown was that Page had been on the FBI’s radar since at least 2013, when Russian officials allegedly tried to use him to get information about the energy business.

	In 2013, at least three years before his association with Trump’s campaign, Page met with a Russian intelligence operative named Victor Podobnyy in New York City, according to the report.

	...The court filing includes a colorful transcript of Podobnyy speaking with Sporyshev about trying to recruit Page.

	...“I also promised him a lot…this is intelligence method to cheat, how else to work with foreigners? You promise a favor for a favor. You get the documents from him and tell him to go fuck himself.”

	...We reported previously, in our Company Intelligence Report 2016/135 of 19 October 2016 from the same source, that COHEN met officials from the PA Legal Department clandestinely in an EU country in August 2016. This was in order to clean up the mess left behind by western media revelations of TRUMP ex-campaign manager MANAFORT's corrupt relationship with the former pro-Russian YANUKOVYCH regime in Ukraine and TRUMP foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE'S secret meetings in Moscow with senior regime figures in July 2016. According to the Kremlin advisor, these meeting/ s were originally scheduled for COHEN in Moscow but shifted to what was considered an operationally "soft" EU country when it was judged too compromising for him to travel to the Russian capital.

	...COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/105

	...Given YANUKOVYCH'S (unimpressive) record in covering up his own corrupt tracks in the past, PUTIN and others in the Russian leadership were skeptical about the ex-Ukrainian president’s reassurances on this as relating to MANAFORT. They therefore still feared the scandal had legs, especially as MANAFORT had been commercially active in Ukraine right up to the time (in March 2016) when he joined TRUMP's campaign team. For them it therefore remained a point of potential political vulnerability and embarrassment.

	By their nature, Russian influence campaigns are multifaceted and designed to be deniable because they use a mix of agents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false-flag operations.

    In an effort to make Soviet espionage less detectable and more deniable, the main responsibility for intelligence collection was shifted from “legal” to “illegal” residencies, which operated independently of Soviet diplomatic and trade missions. In later years the establishment of a new illegal residency became an immensely time-consuming operation which involved years of detailed training and the painstaking construction of “legends” to give the illegals false identities.

	...In the wider context of TRUMP campaign/Kremlin co-operation, Source E claimed that the intelligence network being used against CLINTON comprised three elements. Firstly there were agents/facilitators within the Democratic Party structure itself; secondly Russian emigre and associated offensive cyber operators based in the US; and thirdly, state- sponsored cyber operatives working in Russia. All three elements had played an important role to date. On the mechanism for rewarding relevant assets based in the US, and effecting a two-way flow of intelligence and other useful information, Source E claimed that Russian diplomatic staff in key cities such as New York, Washington DC and Miami were using the emigre ‘pension’ distribution system as cover. The operation therefore depended on key people in the US Russian emigre community for its success. Tens of thousands of dollars were involved.

	The Sword and the Shield - The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB
	by Christopher Andrew

	Publication date 1999

	...The files showed that before the Second World War the greatest foreign successes had been achieved by a legendary group of intelligence officers, often referred to as the “Great Illegals.” After the Second World War, the KGB had tried to recreate its pre-war triumphs by establishing an elaborate network of “illegal residencies” alongside the “legal residencies” which operated under diplomatic or other official cover in foreign capitals.

	The records of Directorate S revealed some remarkable individual achievements. KGB illegals successfully established bogus identities as foreign nationals in a great variety of professions ranging from Costa Rican ambassador to piano tuner to the Governor of New York.

	...THE MAIN LEGACY of the KI period to the subsequent development of Soviet intelligence was a renewed emphasis on illegals who, it was believed, would eventually establish a more secure and better-concealed foundation for foreign intelligence operations than the legal residencies, particularly in the United States.

	...Grigulevich’s astonishing transformation from Soviet saboteur and assassin into a popular and successful Latin American diplomat, combined with the initial success of “Willie” Fisher’s illegal residency in providing “supersecret” nuclear intelligence from the United States, 9 seemed to vindicate the Centre’s early Cold War strategy of attempting to recreate the age of the Great Illegals. The role of the post-war illegals was considered to be potentially even more important than that of their illustrious predecessors.

	...The preparations for a major expansion of the illegal residencies were enormously detailed. In 1954 the Illegals Directorate drew up plans for a network of 130 “documentation agents” whose sole responsibility was to obtain birth certificates, passports and other documents to support the illegals’ legends. Operations officers specializing in illegal documentation were posted in twenty-two Western and Third World residencies, as well as in China and all Soviet Bloc KGB liaison missions.

	...In Czechoslovakia in 1968, as in Hungary in 1956, Andropov’s strategy was based on a mixture of deception and military might. Among the main instruments of deception during the Prague Spring were KGB illegals, all disguised as Westerners. Their deployment in Czechoslovakia in the first of what were henceforth termed PROGRESS operations marked a major innovation in the KGB’s use of illegals. Hitherto illegals had been sent overwhelmingly to the West rather than the East. Most of those deployed within the Soviet Bloc had been sent on missions (codenamed BAYKAL) either to cultivate Western tourists or to monitor contacts between Soviet citizens and Westerners.

	...During the Prague Spring illegals, posing as Western tourists, journalists, business people and students, were for the first time used in significant numbers in a country of the Soviet Bloc for both intelligence collection and active measures. Czechoslovak counter-revolutionaries, the Centre believed, would be much franker in revealing their subversive designs to those they believed Western sympathizers than to their neighbors in eastern Europe.

	...The main task both of the residency’s Line PR and of the KGB liaison with the StB was to identify reliable, pro-Soviet members of the CPCz to form a quisling government after a Soviet invasion.

	...THE KGB ILLEGALS deployed in Czechoslovakia had two main tasks: to penetrate the allegedly counter- revolutionary groups springing up during the Prague Spring in order to report on their subversive intentions; and to implement a series of active measures designed to discredit them.

	...In addition to their other missions during the Prague Spring, the illegals were tasked with a series of active measures collectively codenamed KHODOKI (“gobetweens”), which were intended to justify a Soviet invasion by fabricating evidence of a counter- revolutionary conspiracy by Czechoslovak “rightists” and Western intelligence services. Posing as sympathetic Westerners, the illegals tried to persuade editors and journalists to publish attacks on the Soviet Union and other provocative articles. They also attempted to interest Černý and K-231 in accepting aid from a fictitious underground organization allegedly supplied with arms by the West. Josef Houska, the StB chief sacked by Pavel in June, was secretly informed of operation KHODOKI and agreed to co-operate with it.

	By mid-July, as part of KHODOKI, the illegals had succeeded in planting fabricated evidence of preparations for an armed coup. On July 19 Pravda reported the discovery of a “secret cache” of American weapons near the West German border, some conveniently contained in packages marked “Made in USA,” which had allegedly been smuggled into Czechoslovakia by “revenge seekers and champions of the old order.” The Soviet authorities, it claimed, had also obtained a copy of an American “secret plan” to overthrow the Prague regime. The press throughout the Soviet Bloc followed up Pravda’s story with reports that hidden Western weapons were being discovered all over Czechoslovakia. Simultaneously bogus intelligence was fed to the StB implicating K-231 and KAN in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy with Western intelligence services.

	...At a meeting in Moscow on August 18, the leaders of the Soviet Union and the other four “reliable” members of the Warsaw Pact—Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and Poland—formally agreed on the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the biggest armed action in Europe since the end of the Second World War. 

	...The Centre’s extraordinary successes in penetrating its allies during the Second World War, and the fact that some of its agents remained in place after victory, raised exaggerated expectations of what Soviet intelligence could achieve during the Cold War against the Main Adversary and its NATO allies. KGB post-war strategy was based on an attempt to recreate the pre-war era of Great Illegals, establish a large network of illegal residencies and recruit a new generation of high-flying ideological agents. Alongside the legal residencies in Washington, New York and San Francisco, the Centre planned as late as the early 1980s to set up six illegal residencies, each running agents at the heart of the Reagan administration.

	...They were "the cream of the crop" of trained Russian intelligence agents, he said, and they were sent here to blend in and befriend American policymakers. They were succeeding, Figliuzzi said.

	"Several were getting close to high-ranking officials," he said. One had gone to work for a confidant of a U.S. Cabinet member, he added, declining to offer details.

	...The agents were known as "illegals," because they weren't operating out of Russian embassies or military missions. Instead, they led seemingly normal lives in the U.S.

	...There are certainly items in the dossier that would leave any burrower shaking his head.

	...But some things do tally.

	...A grim case can also be made that the Russians are taking the memos seriously.

	...Further supporting evidence of Steele’s claims can perhaps also be found in the press reports of ongoing federal investigations.

	...Steele’s credentials were the real thing and, apparently, impressive enough to scare the hell out of James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, James Comey, John Brennan, the C.I.A. director, and Admiral Mike Rogers, the N.S.A. director. How else can one explain their collective decision to pass on the still-unverified dossier to the president and the president-elect?

	...Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem peer and former diplomat, said he thought the intelligence agencies would now be trying to get to the bottom of the veracity of the allegations but the dossier showed the hallmarks of the FSB [the modern-day KGB] planting false or heavily embellished information.

	“In this hall of mirrors, anybody can indulge their wildest fantasy theory but you have to ask yourself who benefits. Clearly the CIA doesn’t. Clearly Mr Trump doesn’t. But every aspect benefits Russia,” he said.

	...Factions within The Voice, the best-established and one of the oldest of the nation's so-called alternative newspapers

	...But in one respect almost all staff members agree: editors, essentially, should not edit, and reporters have the right to say anything they want in their articles without the constraint of objectivity and balance in news coverage that is the goal of most traditional newspapers.

	One of the hallmarks of Village Voice columnists and writers is to take strong political positions, usually of the left, and carry on concerted attacks on individuals and institutions they dislike.

	I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE . . . The True Story of the Walkers: An American Spy Family. By Howard Blum

	THERE is a scene in a recent British film that sticks in the mind: John Gielgud, as an upper-class civil servant, seated in his tastefully decorated Georgian town house explaining to an outraged Michael Caine that his betrayal of the realm was "not a moral decision but an esthetic one." In his exquisitely modulated Oxbridge accent, Sir John speaks for all those well-born wallahs - Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Blunt and the rest - who passed military secrets to the Russians out of a muddle of forbidden homosexuality, pinched snobbery and overweening arrogance.

	For a time in the mid-1950's, the pseudopopulist from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, managed to persuade many of his countrymen that American treason had been perpetrated by a similar class of desiccated aristocrats, typified by Alger Hiss and his patron, Dean Acheson.

	Whatever evidence can be produced for that scenario, it is surely not true today. As spy case after spy case bubbles to the surface in the 1980's, it is clear that spies are the product less of a haughty elite than of an American lumpen proletariat - rootless, bored, resentful and mercenary.

	In "I Pledge Allegiance . . ." Howard Blum portrays the most celebrated of this banal new generation of traitors...

	Jerry Whitworth, Accused in Espionage Ring : No One Really Knew Fourth Spy Suspect

	From his youth, accused spy Jerry Alfred Whitworth was always hiding something from those who thought they knew him best.

	...To some, he bragged about becoming an engineer. To others, he talked of becoming a geologist. But when the time would draw near to enroll in a university, he would head back to his enlisted man's job as a communications specialist in the Navy.

	He married into two families, but was a virtual stranger to his in-laws.

	And then, there was his longtime relationship with John A. Walker Jr., 47, of Norfolk, Va.

	I Pledge Allegiance...
	By Howard Blum
	Reviewed by Philip Lentz

	Johnny Walker seemed like such an unlikely spy. A braggart, a womanizer, a hard drinker, he was a man with no convictions, no loyalty to anyone but himself.

	Yet this former naval communications specialist set up a spy ring that resulted in possibly the worst American security breach since World War II, a breach that rattled this country's military and intelligence establishment to its core.

	In the process, he also destroyed his family and his closest friend. By the time he was caught in May, 1985--some 17 years and $750,000 after he first visited the Soviet embassy in Washington--he, his son, his brother and his friend were in jail, his wife had divorced him and his daughters and several in-laws professed open hate of him.

	...Blum is able to give a sense of the bravado, the chaos and the desperation that was Walker's lifestyle


http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-09/news/mn-9818_1_jerry-whitworth
	Lifelong friends and close relatives of Whitworth told The Times that they never heard him mention Walker. But the FBI said that Whitworth, a native of the Paw Paw Bottoms near Muldrow, Okla., and Walker were "best friends" and longtime accomplices in stealing U.S. military secrets for the Soviet Union.

	...Records show that Whitworth and Walker served together in 1970 at the naval communications school in San Diego, but it is not clear if that was their first meeting.

	...From 1973 until his retirement as a senior chief radioman in 1983, FBI affidavits state, Whitworth's work "usually involved security clearances and crypto-communications duties." The FBI says that Whitworth stole a wide variety of sensitive documents.

	It was also during those years in San Diego that Whitworth was first wed, a marriage he rarely spoke of after it ended in divorce a short time later. Some of his close friends and relatives had no recollection last week of that marriage, which took place in 1967 when Whitworth was 28.

	His first bride was 19-year-old Evelyn Margaret Woodhouse, a San Diego State University student with a strong interest in philosophy.

	"As far as I knew, they met through a mutual interest in philosophical problems, philosophical discussions," said Barbara Woodhouse, Evelyn's mother. "He had a great number of books on the mind and the health of the mind."

	Barbara Woodhouse barely knew her son-in-law when the two married--she had only seen him once or twice--but she hoped that he was the right tonic for her emotional daughter.

	...Evelyn eventually remarried and divorced a second time. Her second husband, Frank O. Gilbert, said she never mentioned Whitworth.

	Whitworth finally got some clue to the breakup of his marriage about 12 years later, completely by chance. It came in the form of a telephone call from a now-retired Navy man, who had started dating Woodhouse when her marriage to Whitworth was over.

	The ex-Navy man, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified, said he had spotted Whitworth's name on a roster of Libertarian Party members and remembered that he had been married to Evelyn. He decided to give him a call. It was then that Whitworth learned for the first time that Evelyn had died, apparently by suicide, in March, 1974.

	"He seemed kind of shocked," the man said.

	The conversation lasted perhaps 45 minutes. The man left without strong impressions of Whitworth, except that he seemed "like a working stiff, a (Navy) lifer."

	The retired Navy man recalled that Whitworth said he worked in military communications, but knowing that that was a classified area, he did not ask about details of Whitworth's work.

	One other thing the retired sailor recalled: while Whitworth's name was on the Libertarian mailing list, he did not seem to have particularly strong leanings toward the Libertarian Party, an organization that favors increasing individual liberties by limiting government activities and supports the repeal of laws that limit personal behavior.

	"The one perplexing aspect is that if he was an individualist, why would he stay in the military where you have to take orders," the man questioned.

	Sometime after the two met, Whitworth's evidently removed his name from the Libertarian mailing list.

	Whitworth always strived to be an intellectual, friends say. He had a habit of reading philosophy books and the Wall Street Journal and enjoyed watching the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on public television. He enjoyed listening to classical music and preparing gourmet meals.

	...Less than six months after Whitworth's 1983 retirement, the FBI in San Francisco began receiving letters, signed, "Rus, Somewhere, USA." Authorities believe that Whitworth was the author.

	In the first letter, dated May 8, 1984, "Rus" said he has been involved in espionage for several years, passing "top secret cryptographic key lists for military communications." He offered to cooperate with authorities, so long as he received immunity and they did not disclose his identity. The letter said that at least three other persons had been recruited into the spy ring.

	The next letter was dated May 21, 1984. It again asked for immunity. The writer said the ring had been operating "more than 20 years." In a final letter, dated Aug. 13, 1984, the author said he had concluded that "it would be best to give up on the idea of aiding in the termination of the espionage ring previously discussed." No more letters arrived.

	Within a year, the FBI began making arrests, first of John Walker, the retired Navy communications specialist who ran a Norfolk private detective agency, then Walker's son, Michael, who is accused of passing documents to his father who sent them on to the Soviets, then John Walker's brother Arthur, and finally, last Monday, Whitworth.

	In the searches of Walker and Whitworth's homes, authorities discovered letters Whitworth wrote to Walker, apparently in the last year or so.

	In the first letter, addressed, "Dear Johnnie," Whitworth said he was not working and had applied for no jobs. He mentioned that he was thinking about looking for a job in computer sales or stock brokerage.

	"I realize this doesn't fit in with your advice and counseling over the years," he wrote. "Your help has been rewarding and I greatly appreciate all that you've done for me in the past.

	"I can't specifically say what it was, but I believe it relates to psychological benefits one gains from autonomous decision making. In other words, striking out independently in pursuit of one's goals.

	"In all honesty, I was happier in the '60s and '70s than I've been since. I have agonized over this decision. I hope you can understand and respect it."

	In another letter, Whitworth talked about his wife's job prospects and said he was again working at becoming a stockbroker.

	"There have been many reflections on my decision to retire and subsequent decision. . . . When it gets to the bottom line though, I believe that once Brenda and I are into our new careers that I'll be happy with my strategy and that it will succeed. This period (October, 1983, to now) has been rough on my mental health at times."

	One of the items found by the FBI in Whitworth's trailer was an envelope labled "Job Advertisements." Inside was a classified ad for a communications specialist, requiring security clearance.

	John Walker enclosed the personal letters in an envelope allegedly to his Soviet contact, evidently trying to explain why Whitworth had stopped being a source of information. But in a note by Walker to the Soviets, the accused head of the spy ring predicted that Whitworth's resolve would weaken.

	Referring to Whitworth by the initial "D," Walker wrote: "D continues to be a puzzle. He is not happy but is still not ready to continue our cooperation. Rather than try to analyze him for you, I have simply enclosed portions of two letters I've received.

	"My guess . . . is he is going to flop in the stockbroker field and can probably make a modest living in computer sales. He has become accustomed to the big spender life style and I don't believe he will adjust to living off his wife's income, he will attempt to renew cooperation within two years."

	Whitworth appeared in court twice last week, each time wearing a brown suede wind breaker, once wearing Levis, the other time wearing gray slacks. Bespectacled and balding with a trimmed beard, he said nothing to the magistrate and showed no emotion. He faces life in prison if convicted.

	AS Howard Blum tells us in his deftly written and carefully researched new book, John A. Walker Jr., retired U.S. Navy chief warrant officer, was almost, but not quite, the perfect spy.

	...In 1968, Walker was a highly competent communications technician with a thorough knowledge of naval cipher machines and systems. He was also broke, depressed and despairing of his future, when he slipped into the Soviet Embassy in Washington. When he was smuggled out, he had $2,000 or $3,000 in his pocket -- he can't remember how much. For the next 17 years, Johnny Walker passed his Soviet controller every scrap of communications intelligence he could get his hands on. As he told an interrogator, "If I had access, color it gone."

	AS HIS own Navy service was coming to term, Walker envisaged a romantic and profitable second career as a spymaster. He recruited a friend, Jerry Whitworth...


http://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/us/doubts-raised-about-origin-of-walker-s-spy-ring.html
	DOUBTS RAISED ABOUT ORIGIN OF WALKER'S SPY RING

	WASHINGTON, Sept. 5— John A. Walker Jr. failed recent polygraph tests and prosecutors are concerned that the Navy veteran is lying about the origins of his career as a Soviet spy, law-enforcement officials and others familiar with the case said today.

	One source close to the investigation said that Mr. Walker, a former Navy warrant officer, had been found to be deceptive when questioned about whether he or his brother Arthur had formed a spy ring that the Government has described as one of the most damaging espionage operations in American history. 

	If Arthur J. Walker was the one who started the espionage ring, officials said, it could mean that the spy operation did even more damage than is now believed. In his Navy career, Arthur Walker, who was a lieutenant commander when he retired, had access to extensive secret information about the United States submarine fleet.

	...Mr. Walker has asserted that he created the Soviet espionage operation. His brother, Arthur, was convicted of espionage that was carried out after he retired from the service. He was sentenced to life in prison.

	...The plea agreement called for Mr. Walker to plead guilty and to testify at the espionage trial of Jerry A. Whitworth, another Navy veteran accused of being a member of the ring.

	Mr. Whitworth, 47 years old, was convicted of espionage and was sentenced last month to 365 years in prison. Under the sentence, Mr. Whitworth would have to serve a minimum of 69 years in prison before being eligible for parole.

	Under the plea agreement, Mr. Walker was to be sentenced to life in prison; Michael Walker, who was a seaman in the Navy, would face a 25-year sentence. Both father and son could be freed on parole years earlier, and defense lawyers said the plea agreement could hasten parole.

	...It is not clear why Mr. Walker might lie at this point. The plea agreement is contingent on his truthfulness in interviews with prosecutors.

	One source suggested that Mr. Walker, by withholding valuable information about the spy ring, might be trying to ingratiate himself with Soviet officials, hoping the Soviet Union might later seek to bring him to Moscow in a spy exchange.

	"With this guy, there's always an angle," the source said.

	"The K.G.B. has been for many years the real power in the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Kalugin said in an interview. "Its spokesmen still tell many lies."

	...Disclosures about spies fairly trip off his tongue in conversation. His own greatest coup, an agent known in the trade as a "walk-in," was John A. Walker Jr., a United States Navy warrant officer who offered his services while he was stationed in Washington in 1966 and, Mr. Kalugin said, made more than $1 million from the Soviets before the F.B.I. caught up with him in 1985.

	"Now he's in prison and doomed to stay there until the end of his life, I'm quite sure," Mr. Kalugin said.

	"We used to have great agents," he said with a sigh, "but people stopped coming to work for us for ideological and idealistic reasons after Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes in his secret speech in 1956."

	...on Monday, federal prosecutors accused 11 people of being part of a Russian espionage ring, living under false names and deep cover in a patient scheme to penetrate what one coded message called American “policy making circles.”

	An F.B.I. investigation that began at least seven years ago culminated with the arrest on Sunday of 10 people in Yonkers, Boston and northern Virginia. The documents detailed what the authorities called the “Illegals Program,” an ambitious, long-term effort by the S.V.R., the successor to the Soviet K.G.B., to plant Russian spies in the United States to gather information and recruit more agents.

	...“The magnitude, and the fact that so many illegals were involved, was a shock to me,” said Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general who was a Soviet spy in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s under “legal” cover as a diplomat and Radio Moscow correspondent. “It’s a return to the old days, but even in the worst years of the cold war, I think there were no more than 10 illegals in the U.S., probably fewer.”

	THE MITROKHIN ARCHIVE

	...When the German magazine Focus reported in December 1996 that a former KGB officer had defected to Britain with "the names of hundreds of Russian spies," Tatyana Samolis, spokeswoman for the SVR, instantly ridiculed the whole story as "absolute nonsense." "Hundreds of people! That just doesn't happen!" she declared. "Any defector could get the name of one, two, perhaps three agents—but not hundreds!"

    The facts, however, are far more sensational even than the story dismissed as impossible by the SVR. The KGB defector had brought with him to Britain details not of a few hundred but of thousands of Soviet agents and intelligence officers in all parts of the globe, some of them "illegals" living under deep cover abroad, disguised as foreign citizens.

	Reviews "I Pledge Allegiance: The True Story of the Walk-Ira: An American Spy Family," by Howard Blum 

	...It's obvious that Howard Blum, an award-winning Investigative reporter with The New York Times, is no novice at chasing down the facts. Blum's dedication to telling the truth...

	...A copy of one of the code keys is the first thing Walker gave to the Russians. It's scary how simple it was for him to accomplish. After sneaking a key to the copier and the copy out of the base, he traveled to Washington and, with some difficulty, found the Russian embassy. All he had to do was walk in and give it to them, and he did. From that chilly February day, John Walker was a spy.

	Based on two books--"Family of Spies: Inside the John Walker Spy Ring" by Pete Earley and "I Pledge Allegiance" by Howard Blum--the miniseries carries the following disclaimer: "Certain events and characters portrayed herein have been fictionalized." Those events and characters aren't identified, so believe "Family of Spies" at your own risk.

	...There's a puzzling bit of business here concerning Whitworth's apparent attempt to betray Walker. What does it mean? And although part of the ring, Walker's brother appears so fleetingly that he's a conspirator almost in absentia.

	Otherwise, "Family of Spies" is irresistibly good.

	Blum's book, Dark Invasion, is about the campaign and the effort of American law enforcement to crack what Blum calls "the first terrorist cell in America." It's filled with fascinating characters, from the duplicitous German ambassador who held the title of Count, to Capt. Franz von Rintelen, who plotted destruction while living at the Yacht Club in New York, to the NYPD bomb squad detective who in effect formed an anti-terrorist squad to try to find the saboteurs.

	"There really wasn't anyone at first who could put it all together," Blum tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. "Ships are blowing up at sea, or catching fire, factories are blowing up. Are these accidents? Are these industrial sabotage? No one really suspected a spy network."

	THE CHEKA’S INTELLIGENCE operations both at home and abroad were profoundly influenced not merely by the legacy of the Okhrana but also by the Bolsheviks’ own pre-Revolutionary experience as a largely illegal clandestine underground. Many of the Bolshevik leadership had become so used to living under false identities before 1917 that they retained their aliases even after the Revolution: among them the Russian nobleman Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who kept the pseudonym Lenin, and the Georgian Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, who continued to be known as Stalin. Both Lenin and Stalin retained many of the habits of mind developed during their underground existence. On highly sensitive matters Lenin would insist no copy be made of his instructions and that the original either be returned to him for destruction or destroyed by the recipient. Happily for the historian, his instructions were not always carried out.

	New Lights on the Russian Revolution

	June 14, 1919

	...At first the Bolsheviki were nurst by the Czar, later by the Kaiser. The most violent of the Bolshevik leaders in the Duma, Malinovsky, a close friend of Lenin, turned out to be a police spy and *provocateur*, and his fiery speeches attacking the Government and the bourgeoisie were written for him by Beletzky of the Police Department.


https://books.google.com/books?id=6BAWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209#v=onepage&q&f=false
    Upon assuming the directorship of Fontanka, Beletskii ordered a massive penetration of Russian society by his field bureaus especially among the peasantry, railway workers, high school students and Russia's military and naval forces 'without delay' ...Like Plehve, he wished no nook nor cranny of possible dissent to escape his attention. However, Beletskii was not satisfied with simply spying on society, he wanted to control it as well. The relationship between public opinion (the Duma and the press) and the workers' movement became the focus of Beletskii's experiment in social control.

	...Fontanka devised a stategy to manipulate the Bolshevik movement into disrupting moderate social democracy. Bolshevism by its very nature offered the perfect vehicle for this strategy. Historians have noted that the decision to adopt this strategy was a grossly ill-considered one. After all what did Beletskii and the Special Section accomplish? As Laura Engelstein and Victoria Bonnell (among others) have pointed out, Fontanka's strategy ensured the demise of moderate social democracy in Russia by producing frustration and anger amongst young workers, the potential leaders of their class. Beletskii's strategy drove these young men and women into the arms of the radical intelligentsia, who promised that by rejecting moderation in favour of extremism the workers would attain the economic and political goals they so desired. The end result contributed, therefore, to placing Lenin and his Bolsheviks at the forefront of the labour movement.


https://books.google.com/books?id=szO2W7zF69kC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13
	The Okhrana's penetration of the Bolshevik party was so extensive and so thorough that the police files constitute the most complete (and only reliable) record of the conspiratorial party's early history, internal organization, membership, and deliberations--an unintentional contribution to future historians. This was not the only unintended consequence. By penetrating the radical groups, the tsarist police were using a classic divide-and-conquer tactic to prevent formation of a unified opposition. Ironically, this tactic was most successful in preventing the emergence of an open opposition party with a mass base, and thus it helped to create an environment in which Lenin's small monolithic party of professional revolutionaries could flourish.


https://books.google.com/books?id=6BAWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209#v=onepage&q&f=false
	...Yet, strange as it may seem since Bolsheviks were the enemy of Tsardom Beletskii apparently supported and fostered a movement and its leader for whom he and the analysts of the Special Section had considerable respect. Certainly, there must have been more to the Special Section's and Beletskii's rationale than the discovery that Bolshevism could be easily penetrated by their sotrudniki (a circumstance not unique to Bolshevism in any case) and the belief that Lenin's fractious personality was not conducive to party unity.


https://books.google.com/books?id=V3IeAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA418&lpg=PA418
	...The charge that the Bolshevik movement was secretly encouraged by the Russian Government before the war is confirmed by Serge Persky in the latest volume of his journalistic articles, From Nicholas II to Lenin. He has a photograph of notes of a speech delivered by Malinovsky in the Duma which had been OK'd and annotated by the Minister Maarof. Pravda ("Truth"), the official organ of the Bolshevists, was subsidized by the Okhrana (secret police), and Lenin himself in 1910 or 1911 had relations with them. When this was exposed Lenin defended himself in the same fashion as when charged with receiving German aid:

		It was not the Okhrana that made use of us but on the contrary we that made use of the Okhrana. Without doubt the Okhrana has rendered great services to our party without ever obtaining anything from us.

	Altho all these authors are strongly opposed to the Bolsheviki and we have nothing on the other side, still their standpoints are so diverse otherwise that we may get from them a tolerably correct view of the early stages of the revolution.


https://archive.org/details/TheSwordAndTheShield-TheMitrokhinArchiveAndTheSecretHistoryOfTheKGB
	The KGB’s effusive public tributes to its saintly founding father concealed the degree to which Dzerzhinsky derived his intelligence tradecraft from the Cheka’s much smaller Tsarist predecessor, the Okhrana. The Bolsheviks had extensive first-hand experience of the Okhrana’s expertise in the use of penetration agents and agents provocateurs. In July 1913 Lenin had discussed the difficult problem of Okhrana penetration with two of his chief lieutenants, Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinovyev, and the leader of the Bolshevik deputies in the Duma, Roman Malinovsky. All were agreed that there must be an unidentified Okhrana agent in close contact with the Bolshevik deputies. The agent was in even closer contact than Lenin realized. It was Roman Malinovsky.
 
 
http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSmalinovsky.htm
    Bukharin wrote to Lenin claiming that when he was hiding in Moscow he was arrested by the police just after a meeting with Malinovsky. He was convinced that Malinovsky was a spy. Lenin wrote back that if Bukharin joined in the campaign of slander against Malinovsky he would brand him publicly as a traitor. Understandably, Bukharin dropped the matter. ...Instead of carrying out an investigation into Malinovsky, Lenin made him his deputy inside Russia.
 
 
https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZNuZ6fq1WoC&pg=PA230
	...Lenin had named Dr. Zhitomirsky, Okhrana agent delegated to shadow him, from 1902 to 1917 ...When the Congresss split, naturally Zhitomirsky sided with Lenin.
 
 
https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZNuZ6fq1WoC&pg=PA536
    In 1911, Zhitomirsky finally fell under suspicion, but it was not his chief who suspected him. Lenin received a warning from Vladimir Burtsev. Now warnings from Burtsev were no small matter, for he was a self-constituted, one-man, counter-espionage agency. As some collect coins or stamps or feminine conquests, he collected spies. He it was who had shortly before exposed the incomparable Azev, director of the Fighting Section of the Social Revolutionary Party. Yet so sure was Lenin of his most trusted agent that he ignored the warning.
 
    A revolutionary bloodhound by vocation, Burtsev, once he had scented a spy, was not to be put off the trail. By 1913 he had gathered so much evidence that he sent Lenin an ultimatum. He would create a public scandal if trust were not withdrawn from this man. "If my charges are false, let him haul me before a revolutionary tribunal. There he will prove his innocence or I my charges."
 
    Alarmed at last, Lenin sent another "man of confidence" to take up the Zhitomirsky matter with Burtsev, and, at the same time, to discuss the whole problem of combatting the spies with which the Bolshevik movement was now obviously infested. The man whom Lenin sent was Roman Malinovsky!
 
    Malinovsky questioned Burtsev with strained interest. Who in the police or government was giving him his secret tips? what reasons had he for suspecting Dr. Zhitomisky? how could the Bolsheviks judge the reliability of such grave charges unless they were given the sources? what other Bolsheviks did he suspect?
 

https://archive.org/details/TheSwordAndTheShield-TheMitrokhinArchiveAndTheSecretHistoryOfTheKGB
	Stalin continued to doctor his own pre-Revolutionary record during the 1920s, changing even the day and year of his birth; the correct date (December 6, 1878) was not made public until 1996. During a visit to the secret section of the Moscow Main Archives Directorate (Glavarkhiv), Mitrokhin was once shown an Okhrana file on Dzhugashvili. The file cover and title followed standard Okhrana format, but, on looking inside, Mitrokhin discovered that the contents had been entirely removed. The probability is that the Okhrana had compromising materials on the young Dzhugashvili, and that at the first opportunity Stalin arranged for the file to be gutted. In typical Soviet bureaucratic fashion, however, the cover was preserved since the existence of the file was indelibly recorded in the secret registers. Mitrokhin suspects that whoever emptied the file, presumably on Stalin’s instructions, was later eliminated to preserve the dark secret of its missing contents. What Stalin was most anxious to destroy may well have been evidence that he had been an Okhrana informer. Though it falls well short of conclusive proof, a possible trace of that evidence still survives. According to reports from an Okhrana agent discovered in the State Archive of the Russian Federation, Baku Bolsheviks before the First World War “confronted Dzhugashvili-Stalin with the accusation that he was a provocateur and an agent of the Security Police. And that he had embezzled Party funds.”

	The presence of many psychologically unbalanced individuals and criminals in the repressive organs of the Bolshevik state does not answer fully what seems to be one of the most essential, albeit neglected, questions associated with the Red Terror policy: how did the Bolsheviks find hundreds and even thousands of individuals willing, and often eager, to jail, guard, interrogate, torture, and execute? This question is appropriate indeed since the Cheka deputy director Peters conceded that his agency had trouble recruiting cadres because people were too 'sentimental' to take part in the repressive work of the new regime, failing to distinguish between the Cheka and the tsarist secret police, the hated Okhrana. In part, this was due to the fact that among the Cheka functionaries there were many former Okhrana employees. At the same time, a disproportionate number of the Cheka personnel were non-Russians, most commonly Armenians, Jews and Latvians, whom Lenin seemed to favour strongly, demonstrating ill-disguised bigotry in considering them to be 'more brutal and less susceptible to bribery' than the 'soft Russians'. Many of these foreigners had previously taken part in the struggle against Russian imperial domination, including Dzerzhinksii (a Pole, who as a youth wanted to 'exterminate all Muscovites') and his deputies, Latvian radicals Martyn Latsis and Peters. Perhaps even more revealing, however, was that, in general, among Russian and non-Russian revolutionaries involved in consolidating the Soviet state by promoting Lenin's policy of the Red Terror, surprisingly large numbers had participated in terrorist practices under the tsarist regime.

	For many professional extremists whose primary occupation before 1917 was bloodletting, the Revolution presented an opportunity to return from their places of imprisonment or foreign exile and apply themselves once again to what they did best. After the Bolshevik take-over they joined and often led such organs of state-perpetrated terrorism as the provincial and district sections of the Cheka. Former terrorists also worked in the revolutionary tribunals and, after 1922, in the repressive organs of the GPU.


https://archive.org/details/TheSwordAndTheShield-TheMitrokhinArchiveAndTheSecretHistoryOfTheKGB
	Brushing aside complaints of Cheka brutality, [Lenin] paid fulsome tribute to its role in helping to win the civil war. The Cheka, he claimed, had proved a “devastating weapon against countless conspiracies and countless attempts against Soviet power by people who are infinitely stronger than us”: “devastating weapon against countless conspiracies and countless attempts against Soviet power by people who are infinitely stronger than us”: 

		Gentlemen capitalists of Russia and abroad! We know that it is not possible for you to love this establishment. Indeed, it is not! [The Cheka] has been able to counter your intrigues and your machinations as no one else could have done when you were smothering us, when you had surrounded us with invaders, and when you were organizing internal conspiracies and would stop at no crime in order to wreck our peaceful work.

	Some of the most secret documents in Dzerzhinsky’s archive carry a note that only ten copies were to be made: one for Lenin, the rest for Cheka department chiefs. Lenin’s absorption in the affairs of the Cheka extended even to operational detail. He sent Dzerzhinsky advice on how to carry out searches and conduct surveillance, and instructed him that arrests were best carried out at night.


https://archive.org/details/TheSwordAndTheShield-TheMitrokhinArchiveAndTheSecretHistoryOfTheKGB
	From almost the beginning of the civil war in 1918, in keeping with the Bolshevik tradition of operating under false identities, the Cheka began sending officers and agents under various disguises and pseudonyms behind enemy lines to gather intelligence. By June 1919 the number of these “illegals” was sufficiently large to require the foundation of an illegals operations department (later to become Directorate S of the KGB First Chief Directorate). KGB classified histories note that henceforth “illegal” operations became “an inseparable part of foreign intelligence.” On December 20, 1920, the third anniversary of the Cheka’s foundation, a new foreign department (Innostranyi Otdel or INO) was set up to direct all operations beyond Soviet borders. During the early years of Soviet Russia, when the Communist regime remained an international pariah, it had few official missions abroad capable of providing official cover for “legal” intelligence stations (“residencies” in Cheka jargon) and thus relied chiefly on illegals.

	I.W.W. Deportation Cases

	...Katie Cohen, alias Sadie Cohen, aged 26, native and citizen of Russia ...she denied that she was an anarchist, either then or at the time of her entry. she did admit, however, having attended anarchist meetings held by Emma Goldman.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman
	Born in Kovno, Russian Empire, ...Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth.

	In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to "induce persons not to register" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia.

	...After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. 


http://spartacus-educational.com/USAczolgosz.htm
	On May 6, 1901, Czolgosz travelled to Cleveland to hear Emma Goldman make a speech at the Federal Liberal Club. Afterwards Czolgosz spoke briefly to Goldman. He also followed her back to Chicago and attended other meetings where she made speeches on anarchism. Abraham Isaak became convinced that Czolgosz was a spy and issued a warning about him in his journal, the Free Society.

	While in Chicago Czolgosz read that President William McKinley was planning to visit the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo. On 3rd September Czolgosz bought a pistol and two days later was in the audience when McKinley gave a speech at the Temple of Music. Although surrounded by fifty bodyguards, Czolgosz was able to walk up to McKinley and fire two shots at him. Hit in the chest and abdomen, McKinley shouted out "Be easy with him, boys" as secret service agents beat Czolgosz with fists and pistol butts.

	William McKinley was taken to hospital where it was discovered that the chest wound was superficial but the other bullet had torn through the stomach wall. For the first few days his condition improved and newspapers reported that he would recover. However, the path of the bullet that had passed through the wall of the stomach and his kidney, had turned gangrenous and he died on the 14th September, 1901.

	When questioned Czolgosz claimed he had been incited to kill McKinley by the speeches of Emma Goldman. She was arrested and imprisoned for questioning. When she was finally released she shocked the public by stating that: "He (Czolgosz) had committed the act for no personal reasons or gain. He did it for what is his ideal: the good of the people. That is why my sympathies are with him." However, as Bill Falkowski pointed out: "He (Czolgosz) was roundly denounced by spokespersons of the Left, with the lone sympathetic exception of Emma Goldman, who nonetheless advised against individual acts of political violence."

	Leon Czolgosz was tried and found guilty of killing McKinley. Before being executed on 20th October, 1901, Czolgosz remarked that: "I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people. I am not sorry for my crime."

	Book Review: How the plan to fall apart soon fell apart

	In 'The World That Never Was,' Alex Butterworth details how anarchism became violent and discredited with help from secret police and agents provocateurs.

	...Peter Rachkovsky is Butterworth's principal villain, a shady character who began his career in black operations as a mole within the People's Will, the revolutionary group whose assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 set off a wave of repression sending many rebels into exile. In Switzerland, France and England, they inspired fellow refugees and homegrown radicals to dream of emulating the Paris Commune, a short-lived socialist experiment savagely suppressed by the Third Republic in 1871. Rachkovsky followed his prey abroad; as head of the Paris branch of the Okhrana, he planted agents among the émigrés who goaded angry, naïve young people into what the author describes as "heinous crimes of which they might never have otherwise conceived." Butterworth credibly documents instances across Europe in which a mysterious figure appeared in anarchist circles, armed with cash and access to explosives, provoked them to target public places for maximum damage, then vanished just as the police swooped in — sometimes before the bombs went off, sometimes not.

	It was a risky strategy, especially in England, where Special Branch officer William Melville kept a wary eye cocked on superiors who might like his results but were less prepared than their French or Russian counterparts to condone his tactics if they came to light. Unfortunately for anarchism's reputation, it was a successful strategy, because leading theorists like Peter Kropotkin, while privately appalled by terrorist acts, were unwilling to publicly denounce them.


http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/9813/1/341813.pdf
	The teachings of various anarchist thinkers - Proudhon, Stimer, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Tolstoy - were introduced to China, but most Chinese anarchists' favourite theory was Kropotkin's anarchist communism. As an ideology imported from abroad, anarchism could take root in China rapidly not only because it was in harmony with Chinese traditional Taoist thought, but also because the anarchist teachings of opposition to authority and oppression had a strong appeal for radical Chinese youth, who felt these ideas were simple and direct. For a period of time, anarchism became the mainstream of Chinese radical thinking.
 
    ...Polevoy and other agents ardently desired to expand their contacts with anarchists and other radicals throughout China. ...For this purpose, the Bolshevik agents used to make use of certain anarchists as intermediaries.


http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/9813/1/341813.pdf
    Another Chinese whom Popov visited was someone called Chin, who was reported to be an "anarchist working on a Chinese paper of Shanghai." ...It is worth noticing that, when Joffe arrived in Shanghai in 1923 he wrote a letter to a Chinese of the "New Russia Society" in Shanghai, whose surname was "Ch'in".  ...No matter who this "Chin" or "Chin" was, it indicated that the agents of Soviet Russia and the Comintern were successful in gaining the co-operation of some important Chinese anarchists.

    ...many anarchists sympathized with and supported the Bolshevik Revolution from the very beginning. Since the events of the October Revolution followed in some ways the pattern anticipated by the anarchist theorists, for instance, the expropriation of the bourgeoisie, seizure of the means of production and establishment of workers' control and abolition of class distinctions and civil ranks, some anarchists regarded them as having met "certain fundamental principles and methods of Anarchist Communism. " The Chinese anarchists also hailed Russia's social revolution. A Chinese anarchist periodical Laodong (Labour Monthly) wrote: "Now China's neighbor Russia has waged a just and honorable social revolution to make equal the rich and the poor. " Another article in this periodical even described the Russian Bolsheviks as espousing anarcho-communism and thus regarded them as their "Russian brothers". Zhu Qianzhi, an anarchist student at Beijing University, expressed the opinion of many Chinese anarchists when he wrote that: "at that time the ordinary youths in China who advocated revolution, admired Russia's success and tried to use violent force to achieve the goals [of anarchism]."

    ...the Bolsheviks made efforts to draw support from anarchists internationally. Since most anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists glorified revolution and advocated "direct action" by the masses to destroy capitalist rule, Lenin counted on them to play an important role in the "World Revolution".


http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/01/entertainment/la-ca-alex-butterworth-20100801
	Kropotkin and such comrades as Errico Malatesta and Paris Commune veteran Elisée Reclus, who had all served jail terms, knew that authorities would defend the status quo with every weapon at their disposal. The 1887 execution of four anarchists dubiously connected to a bombing in Chicago's Haymarket Square grimly reinforced their belief that the capitalist democracies were also owned by the ruling class.

	...These homeless and rootless men formed a brotherhood of the road with its own myths and legends, celebrating their shared hardships in anthems such as 'Hallelujah, I'm a bum' and 'Paint 'Er red!', collected in their *Little Red Songbook*. Regularly abused, beaten, jailed, thrown off moving trains by brakemen--in four years 4,000 of them were killed and 25,000 injured on the railroads--they were well schooled in violence and had little to lose by using it.

	...the IWW had consistently opposed the war. Slogans such as 'Don't be a soldier, be a man', and appeals not to fight the battles of Rockefeller, J.P Morgan and other monopoly capitalists, had enraged a population conditioned by powerful government propaganda to support the the fighting and hate the Germans. Newspapers, particularly those owned by the capitalists vilified by the IWW, openly encouraged their readers to exterminate Wobblies: 'Kill them,' screamed the *Tulsa Daily World*, 'as you would any other kind of snake.' Members were beaten, whipped, tarred and feathered and, during a miners' strike at Butte, Montana, lynched.

	...They stood by, unable to distance themselves from a series of increasingly lunatic attacks in the 1890s that culminated, in 1900-1, with the assassinations of Italy's Umberto I and U.S. President William McKinley. Propaganda by deed had become, in Butterworth's cogent summary, "no more than envious arbitrary retribution; the last resort of the hopeless, the damaged and the dispossessed."

	The author's acid descriptions of nefarious police maneuvers, the cynical manipulation of public opinion (inflammatory "anarchist" pamphlets written by undercover agents) and the arrogant intransigence of factory owners confident the government would take their side make it clear that he sympathizes with the anarchists' revulsion at an unjust economic system and the political systems that protected it. He also understands that anarchists could be their own worst enemies, distracted from the hard work of building a popular movement by the glamour of revolutionary violence that made the bourgeoisie tremble. He grudgingly admires the "dark genius" of Rachkovsky, who not only blackened anarchism's name but planted the seeds for future generations of malignant libels with "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the anti-Semitic forgery that Butterworth and other historians believe was commissioned by Rachkovsky.

	...[Cohen] further admits that she attended radical meetings with William Judin and sold copies of the Social War, now know as the Social War Bulletin. She admits that this is an anarchistic publication, and that she knew at the time of selling it that it was such. This publication is the official mouthpiece of an organization known as the International Propaganda Group, or the International Anarchisti Propaganda Group.

	..."Our principles. he International Propaganda Group of Chicago is organized for the purpose pf binging the ideas of anarchism before the working classes. The group advocated a new social order, where private ownership of land, capital, and machinery shall cease to exist..."

	...she attended these meetings to collect money for the benefit of these leagues, as well as for the 11 Italian prisoners confined in the Wisconsin State Penitentiary for their participation in the bomb-throwing episode at Milwaukee; also that at these meetings she was very active in the selling of the Social War ...The Bureau ... has to recommend her deportation to Russia at Government expense when possible.

	...Aliens were each asked whether he believed in the tenets of the organization, and all of them made rather evasive replies, trying to make it appears that they accepted only part of the constitution. No two of them have expressed the same views as to the purposes of the organization, but all have agreed that the federation of the several unions of Russian workers no longer exists because the leaders returned to Russia and that the education of Russians was one of the objects. None of the aliens has made any effort to become a citizen of the United States, and each of them apparently expected to return to Russia when the revolution to which they looked forward developed, and have been unable to do so for one reason or another.

	One hundred and fifty had already been arrested when the Secretary of Labor vetoed the scheme and ordered their release.

	Immigration officials stepped up their active investigation of IWW and other radical elements in Seattle in November 1918, when the first rumblings of the discontent that led to the general strike were felt. Reames reported that shipyard workers were dissatisfied with the basic national wage of $6.40 a day, and drew attention to what he described as the growing Bolshevik or revolutionary propaganda being distributed in the city. He asked for a force of special agents to be dispatched to check out whether the situation was developing into a seditious conspiracy. The Bureau chief, A. Bruce Bielaski, ordered the Seattle office to keep him informed, since he had also received disquieting reports from the Office of Naval Intelligence on IWW and Bolshevik activities.

	...Hanson became regarded as the man who stopped a Bolshevik revolution from happening in America. Labor unionists, anarchists, and socialists sympathetic to the general strike had another view of Mayor Hanson, and on April 28, 1919, a letter bomb mailed from New York City arrived at Hanson’s private residence. Only the fact that Hanson held the package upside down kept the bomb from detonating.

	...The International Workers of the World, also known the IWW or “Wobblies,” were once the most despised organization in America. Fighting for “one big union,” the Wobblies attracted labor unionists with a radical bent. Some Wobblies were anarchists, while others were socialists and communists. However, all IWW members were excoriated as a social scourge—a den of bomb throwers who conspired to undermine the U.S. government and the rule of law.

	The driving force behind the I.W.W. was William D. Haywood, the leader of the Western Federation of Miners, which had established a reputation for work stoppages in Colorado mines. Joining Haywood at the launch of the I.W.W., which he described as the "first continental congress of the working class," were Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party and Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party.

	Eugene V. Debs

	...In the struggle in Russia the revolution has thus far triumphed for the reason that it has not compromised. The career of Kerensky was cut short when he attempted to turn the revolutionary tide into reactionary bourgeois channels.

	...In Russia and Germany our valiant comrades are leading the proletarian revolution, which knows no race, no color, no sex, and no boundary lines. They are setting the heroic example for worldwide emulation. Let us, like them, scorn and repudiate the cowardly compromisers within our own ranks, challenge and defy the robber-class power, and fight it out on that line to victory or death!

	From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I am Bolshevik, and proud of it.

	“The Day of the People has arrived!”

	In the late 1800s, the Puget Sound region was home to a socialist cooperative movement, with the goal of building socialist “colonies” that would grow across Washington.  Eugene V. Debs was one of the early supporters of this movement.

	...Haywood was arrested under the Espionage Act in 1918, along with 165 other leading Wobblies, ninety-nine of whom were found guilty after a five-month criminal trial, the longest in American history.

	Red journalist John Reed, just back from an assignment in Soviet Russia, was struck by the sight of the accused men in the courtroom ...'I doubt if ever in history there has been a sight like them,' he wrote in the *Liberator*. 'A hundred men better fitted to stand up for the social revolution could not have been collected from all America. Lumberjacks, harvest hands, miners, editors ... who believe that the wealth of the world belongs to those who create it ... the outdoor men, hardrock blasters, tree feelers, wheat binders, longshoremen, the boys who do the strong work of the world ... The scene was strangely familiar -- it looked like a meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian soviets in Petrograd!'

	Information reached the Federal authorities here today that William D. ("Big Bill") Haywood, the I.W.W. leader contacted of sedition and sentenced to begin this week a twenty--year term in the Leavenworth Penitentiary, had jumped his bonds of $15,000 and fled to Russia.

	OUT THERE: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials, by Howard Blum. (Pocket, $5.99.) A former reporter for The New York Times tells how the Federal Government has quietly pursued a search for aliens, in one case recruiting psychics to help with the hunt. Last year our reviewer, John A. Adam, said this book "teases our emotions like a novel while raising some serious questions."

	The true-crime section has increasingly become stacked with books that take a dastardly deed as the jumping-off point for some big thoughts about the national narrative. This literary ambition seems intuitively inspired by Marx’s deterministic insight that, although “men make their own history,” they make it under circumstances shaped by their times.

	The Obama Administration has been very aggressive in prosecuting journalists and demanding then to disclose their sources. This is the Democrats. If there's a Trump Administration, then one can only imagine how the attacks against journalists will escalate. It is a scary time to be a reporter - and what makes it so scary is that in these uncertain times investigative reporting is more essential than ever.

Blum paints Walker as a guy caught-up in Soviet espionage due to financial desperation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Anthony_Walker
	In late 1985, Walker made a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, which required him to testify against his co-conspirator, former senior chief petty officer Jerry Whitworth, and provide full details of his espionage activities. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to a lesser sentence for Walker's son, former Seaman Michael Walker, who was also involved in the spy ring.

	John A. Walker Jr., who led family spy ring, dies at 77 

	...Mr. Walker was the central figure in a ring that operated for years and that included his son, Michael, and his older brother, Arthur J. Walker, who died in prison in July. 




https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/05/the-americans-real
	Kalugin worked under diplomatic cover at the Russian Embassy and handled one of the most serious American betrayers in history, John A. Walker Jr., the former Navy warrant officer and mastermind behind a nearly 20-year naval spy ring.








https://news.usni.org/2014/09/02/john-walker-spy-ring-u-s-navys-biggest-betrayal
	Oleg Kalugin, the KGB officer who had first managed Walker, wrote that his was “by far the most spectacular spy case I handled in the United States.”



https://fas.org/irp/eprint/esp-summ.pdf
	WALKER, ARTHUR JAMES
, a retired Navy Lieutenant Commander, was arrested on 29 May 1985 
for providing classified material to his brother in 1981 and 1982. Arthur Walker was employed with a 
defense contractor in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he
 reportedly sought work in early 1980 at the urging 
of his brother, John A. Walker, to gain access to classified documents. 


	...On 12 November, Arthur Walker was sentenced to lif
e imprisonment and fined $250,000. At the time of 
sentencing it was revealed that polygraph tests indicat
ed Walker may have been involved in espionage 
while on active duty with the Navy

	Colvert, now retired and living in Alexandria, still believes that Walker was more involved than he ever admitted. Still, the two had gotten to know each other.

	However, amazingly enough, the extent of the damage done may never have come to light had not Weinberger himself intervened to overrule Secretary of the Navy John Lehman in October 1985. Lehman, as Barron reports, did not want to cut any deals with Walker in order to get him to talk on the witness stand-ostensibly in righteous indigna­tion over the crimes Walker had committed
