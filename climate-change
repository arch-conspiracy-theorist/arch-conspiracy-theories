	California Drought Is Made Worse by Global Warming, Scientists Say

	Global warming caused by human emissions has most likely intensified the drought in California by 15 to 20 percent, scientists said on Thursday, warning that future dry spells in the state are almost certain to be worse than this one as the world continues to heat up.

	...A report this week by researchers at the University of California, Davis, projected that the drought would cost the California economy some $2.7 billion this year. Much of that pain is being felt in the state’s huge farming industry, which has been forced to idle a half-million acres and has seen valuable crops like almond trees and grape vines die.

	Drought, expanding deserts and 'food for jihad' drive Mali's conflict

	...For years, violence has plagued Majga's dusty town, the scene of clashes between government forces and Tuareg-led separatists who took advantage of a 2012 coup in Mali's capital Bamako to escalate their uprising.

	But today, the biggest security concern for the ageing chieftain is a new cycle of ferocious droughts he blames on climate change, that is savaging his people.

	"There is a crisis due to the lack of rain," says Majga

	... Mali's average rainfall has dropped by 30 percent since 1998 with droughts becoming longer and more frequent, according to a 2013 study by the U.S. army's Strategic Studies Institute. 

	As a consequence, hunger is a chronic problem in the West African country with more than 1.8 million people, including 660,000 children, in need of food aid.

	...For generations, people from Menaka have wandered the land with their cows and goats in search of water and grass for grazing. Now, even this is under threat, Majga said.

	The Sahara desert is expanding southward at a rate of 48 kms a year, forcing whole communities to migrate and pushing them on to land occupied by other groups, researchers said in a 2011 study.

	...Experts have long warned of the risk that climate change would worsen conflict in many of the world's poorest regions as different groups struggling to cope with poor rains and growing desertification take up arms to fight over scarce resources.

	Climate Change Seen as Threat to U.S. Security

	WASHINGTON — The changing global climate will pose profound strategic challenges to the United States in coming decades, raising the prospect of military intervention to deal with the effects of violent storms, drought, mass migration and pandemics, military and intelligence analysts say.

	Such climate-induced crises could topple governments, feed terrorist movements or destabilize entire regions, say the analysts, experts at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies who for the first time are taking a serious look at the national security implications of climate change.

	Recent war games and intelligence studies conclude that over the next 20 to 30 years, vulnerable regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, will face the prospect of food shortages, water crises and catastrophic flooding driven by climate change that could demand an American humanitarian relief or military response.

	BRAINWASHED: Climate change activists have been convinced to support the very thing that will murder Mother Nature and collapse our world: Reductions in carbon dioxide

	If there is one thing people ought to know by now, it’s that you can’t believe everything you see on TV or read on the internet. But when it comes to climate change, that seems to be what everyone does. In spite of the overwhelming evidence that the increased amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is encouraging the Earth to grow greener, so-called “climate activists” are still clinging tightly to the long-held belief that carbon is the devil.

	The Paris climate accord — and the liberal media’s outcry following Trump’s decision to disengage from the agreement — is a perfect example of this unwavering belief that carbon dioxide is the cause of our planet’s ailments. But the fact is, that belief couldn’t be any further from the truth.

	As Mike Adams notes, “[A]ll plants depend on CO2 for their very survival. It’s the “oxygen” for plants, and right now trees, grasses and food crops are starving for CO2

	Two degree Celsius warming locks in sea level rise for thousands of years

	A jump in global average temperatures of 1.5°C-2°C will see the collapse of Antarctic ice shelves and lead to hundreds and even thousands of years of sea level rise, according to new research published in Nature.

	...To avoid the loss of the Antarctic ice shelves, and a long-term commitment to many metres of sea-level rise, atmospheric warming needs to be kept below 2°C above present levels.

	"Missing the 2°C target will result in an Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise that could be up to 10 metres higher than today," Dr Golledge said.

	"The stakes are obviously very high -- 10 percent of the world's population lives within 10 metres of present sea level."

	Two members of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) science panel resigned Friday in protest after the agency dismissed other scientists from the board earlier this month.

	...“Like so many of our colleagues and the broader research community, we have deep concerns about the leadership at EPA and its continued obfuscation of scientific evidence and the research enterprise.”

	EPA leadership said last week that it would not renew the positions for at least five academic members of one of its scientific review boards and instead consider replacing them with representatives from industries who are subject to the agency’s regulations. 

	Martin told CNN on Friday that he is worried the new members will not reflect his position on issues like climate change.

	WASHINGTON — The average temperature in the United States has risen rapidly and drastically since 1980, and recent decades have been the warmest of the past 1,500 years, according to a sweeping federal climate change report awaiting approval by the Trump administration.

	...The draft report by scientists from 13 federal agencies, which has not yet been made public, concludes that Americans are feeling the effects of climate change right now. It directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited.

	...The authors note that thousands of studies, conducted by tens of thousands of scientists, have documented climate changes on land and in the air. “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,” they wrote.

	Huelskamp, a firebrand conservative from Kansas who lost his primary on Aug. 2, slowed down the legislative process in the House on Tuesday by objecting to 19 bills his own party had fast-tracked for simple voice votes.

	Voice votes enable members to call out yes or no to approve legislation considered uncontroversial.

	From his seat in the back of the House chamber on Tuesday, Huelskamp objected to each bill, one by one, and asked for roll call votes instead.

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article115348913.html
	U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a firebrand conservative from Western Kansas, wants to be Agriculture Secretary in the new Trump administration.

	Voters in the heavily rural first district of Kansas booted Huelskamp out of office in the Republican primary on Aug. 2. His opponent, physician Roger Marshall, had attacked Huelskamp for voting against the farm bill and being ousted from the House Agriculture Committee, a seat that had been held by Kansans for decades.

	Huelskamp also lost the crucial endorsement of the Kansas Farm Bureau. And he’s deeply unpopular among many of his fellow members of Congress.

	But at a forum on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, a Breitbart News reporter asked Huelskamp “to share with us any discussions you’ve had about becoming agriculture secretary,” according to an article in the farming newsletter Agri-Pulse.

	President-elect Donald Trump recently named Stephen Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, as chief White House strategist. Bannon also ran Trump’s campaign in its final months.

	Huelskamp told Agri-Pulse that “many, many people” have been talking to him about the agriculture secretary job.

	“People who are in the room have been talking to me,” Huelskamp said. “If you’re looking to be an outsider, I would be quite a pick to fit that. We need to drain the swamp. I certainly am not part of that.”

	Climate Change Skeptic Group Seeks to Influence 200,000 Teachers

	Twenty-five thousand science teachers opened their mailboxes this month and found a package from the Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.

	It contained the organization’s book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,” as well as a DVD rejecting the human role in climate change and arguing instead that rising temperatures have been caused primarily by natural phenomena. The material will be sent to an additional 25,000 teachers every two weeks until every public-school science teacher in the nation has a copy, Heartland president and CEO Joseph Bast said in an interview last week. If so, the campaign would reach more than 200,000 K-12 science teachers.

	IDEAS THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE
	
	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), vice chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, will be part of the opening night of the Ninth International Conference on Climate Change (#ICCC9) on Monday, July 7 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. He will deliver his keynote speech, titled “Global Warming as a Power Grab,” at 8:25 p.m. PDT.

	“One of the traits of a fanatic is the willingness to conduct personal attacks, to limit debate, to use questionable facts and to seek government to impose policy on others,” Rohrabacher said.

	...Too often, when congress is asked to pass environmental legislation, the legislation is based on emotional junk science rather than data based on reproducable, rigorous, tested, peer-reviewed results.  In no area has this been more obvious than climate change. Because the Kyoto Treaty and much of the suggested environmental legislation would decimate jobs in southern California, constituents may be interested to learn of the growing scientific consensus that global warming is not manmade, if it is in fact even occuring.

	Deepening controversy around the Trump campaign's Russian ties is barely registering in the early stages of competitive congressional races around the country.

	But if there's one place where investigations into Moscow's support for Donald Trump might matter, it's in Republican Dana Rohrabacher's California district— the increasingly competitive Orange County seat held by a man who can't stop defending the Kremlin.

	From Rohrabacher’s vocal defenses of Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, to his own dealings with an ex-Soviet counterintelligence official who was at that same meeting, to a report that the FBI warned Rohrabacher Russian spies were trying to recruit him, his reputation as Vladimir Putin’s best friend in Congress is landing him in story after unflattering story about Moscow’s broader influence campaign.

	And back home, people are beginning to notice.
