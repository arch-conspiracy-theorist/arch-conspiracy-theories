>Cozy relationships between charter schools and their management companies — in Michigan and nationwide — subject federal funds to serious risks of fraud and abuse, according to a federal audit that drew conclusions similar to those of a 2014 Free Press investigation of charters in the state.

>Traverse City businessman Steven Ingersoll had a vision.

>An optometrist by profession, he developed a theory that improved “visual thinking” helps improve learning. So in 1999, he founded Grand Traverse Academy, the first of what is now four Michigan charter school campuses. He developed the curriculum for the school - called integrated visual learning - and started a management company to run the school. Ingersoll then borrowed money to build facilities and recruited like-minded optometrists for the school board.

>Ingersoll, who also runs charter schools in Hartland and California, said Bay City Academy’s curriculum will be based on three educational pillars — the same used at his other schools.

>The first is integrated visual learning, a concept developed by Ingersoll that helps identify, assess and correct students’ vision. Each of Ingersoll’s schools are equipped with an optometry lab to do this.

>What is IVL?

>...Attention field deflections most commonly develop due to poor oculomotor and visual perceptual abilities which will persist without treatment and, rarely, from delayed development where adequate oculomotor function develops after the child has been required to begin reading and other academic tasks. As effective as vision therapy is at treating the underlying cause of the problem, namely poor eye movement and visual perceptual abilities, it often does not complete the remediation of these deflections, and the individual must be taught how to learn visually

>...Students in Ingersoll’s schools are also taught choice theory, a concept developed by 20th Century psychiatrist William Glasser positing that behavior is central to existence and is driven by five basic needs: survival, belonging, power, freedom and fun/learning.


http://www.excelinstitute.com/ChoiceTheory.htm
>Choice Theory provides an explanation of motivation which is markedly different from what many of us have been taught. Choice Theory teaches that outside events never "make" us to do anything.

>From 1956 to 1986, Dr. Glasser was a private practice psychiatrist. He created what he termed reality therapy and subsequently founded the Institute for Reality Therapy in 1967, which he later renamed the William Glasser Institute. The institute became his full-time occupation, where he teaches his own psychological theories.

>...Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating that there is no evidence that medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of antiestablishment authors. The book reads like an infomercial, with the majority of footnotes suggesting that the reader buy one of the author's other books for more information. Additionally, the institute that bears his name is in the business of educating and promoting the dissemination of choice theory. However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings.

>...Also, despite Glasser's claims that all he wants to do is educate the masses, additional Institute publications about choice theory are expensive.

>...It was not until lawyers for the school began asking questions that the tangled financial relationship between Ingersoll's management company and the charter he founded began to unravel, culminating in the most significant federal criminal case in the history of Michigan’s 20-year-old charter school industry. Ingersoll, who started Smart Schools Management, Inc., stands accused of diverting school construction loan funds to his and wife’s private accounts, accessing school money at will, while hand-picked school board members looked the other way. 

>Ingersoll will go on trial next month on seven criminal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion. The allegations of financial self-dealing and cozy relations between Ingersoll, his associates and board members could not come at a worse time for the Michigan charter movement. The state’s powerful, mostly for-profit charter school industry has found itself on the defensive since the Detroit Free Press published a devastating series last June chronicling how charters receive nearly $1 billion a year in state taxpayer money with little accountability or transparency on how that money is spent. The report detailed how board members at some charter schools were forced out when they pushed to learn more about finances from management companies, and how state law failed to prevent self-enrichment by those operating some low-performing charter schools.

>Moscow has sent more than 10,000 Afghans to the USSR and Eastern Europe for educational and training programs. These programs have developed the Afghans' expertise and Russian-language capabilities, but heavy doses of political training, poor treatment from Soviet instructors and the local population, and the Afghan regime's inability to give graduates suitable positions when they return alienate some students. The recent focus on Afghan youths of elementary school age, who are more vulnerable to indoctrination-especially when separated from their parents and traditions during years of training in the USSR-may have some success in developing regime supporters.

>Political Indoctrination in Rumania
 
>The feeling of Rumanian youths is generally favorable towards the US. The majority are anti-Soviet and do not believe the anti-US propagands. Most of the hope to be delivered from Soviet domination through a war between the US and the USSR.
 
>...The attitude of the Union of Working Youth (Uniunea Tineretului Muneitoreso - UTM) members was outwardly anti-US although only a small number were really Communist indoctrinated. The grammar school children were more likely to be anti-US due to the intensive indoctrination to which they were subjected. Some parents were careful not to let their children know they were listening to the Voice of America broadcasts for fear their children would report them to the authorities

>MI5 believed a hardcore of around 750 teachers was attempting to spread communist propaganda in British schools in the wake of the second world war, documents released today show.

>A secret MI5 memo written in August 1949, released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, charts apparent efforts to recruit teachers and infiltrate the leadership of the National Union of Teachers.

>The document, which traces a Soviet-backed drive to free worldwide education from capitalist "enslavement" back to 1920, also reports attempts to penetrate teaching in British colonies in the early post-war period.

>The report was written against a backdrop of positive vetting by Clement Atlee's government to identify communists in the British civil service and military.

>The document compares the extent of communist penetration in the education system elsewhere, particularly eastern European countries within the Soviet sphere of influence.

>The memo highlights how education had been key to the previous year's communist coup in Czechoslovakia, which effectively consolidated the Eastern Bloc for the next four decades.

>David Cameron has launched a major review into whether Islamist extremists have infiltrated the NHS, the civil service, local authorities and the country’s education system.

>The Prime Minister has ordered officials to carry out an investigation to make sure British institutions are protected from the threat of “entryism” by radicals.

>It follows the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham, where Islamist extremists attempted to take over a number of schools and radicalise children.

>Launching the new extremism strategy today, the Government admitted that it has “inadequate understanding” of the way public bodies can be targeted by extremists.

>Highly unlikely. The circumstances of Lin Biao’s death, his plane supposedly crashing in Mongolia on his way to the Soviet Union, are laughable.
 
>...Lin Biao is said to have launched an assassination attempt against Mao’s personal train, and having failed, hopped aboard a plane bound for Moscow. Disney could not have written a better script.

>...Lin and his proteges had concluded correctly that it was Mao's intention ultimately to purge them. To prevent this and to secure the succession, Lin's group planned a military "coup" against Mao, one which envisaged Mao's assassination if necessary. ...When Lin's plans for a coup were frustrated, he attempted to flee to the USSR
