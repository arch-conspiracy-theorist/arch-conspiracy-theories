	Arpaio has, throughout his tenure as sheriff, sought out media coverage. He has been featured and profiled by worldwide news media, and claims to average 200 television appearances per month


Arpaio not doing his job, showboater, grandstander.

	...During the summer of 2003, when outside temperatures exceeded 110 °F (43 °C), Arpaio said to complaining inmates, "It's 120 degrees in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn't commit any crimes, so shut your mouths!"


Apraio fails to grasp he's a sherriff, not a judge, no respect for legal system


	...One of Arpaio's public-relations actions was the requirement that inmates wear pink underwear in order to prevent its theft by the released inmates. He claims this has saved the county $70,000 in the first year this rule was in effect.[55] Arpaio subsequently started to sell customized pink boxers (with the Maricopa County Sheriff's logo and "Go Joe") as a fund-raiser for Sheriff's Posse Association. Despite allegations of misuse of funds received from these sales, Arpaio declined to provide an accounting for the money


misusing funds?

kindof reminds of of Trump--corrupt, does flashy distracting things
