	The deep-cover Russian spies may not have achieved their objective, but they were not idle. They collected information and transmitted it back to Russia, and they were actively engaged in what is known in the spy business as “spotting and assessing.”

	They identified colleagues, friends, and others who might be vulnerable targets, and it is possible they were seeking to co-opt people they encountered in the academic environment who might one day hold positions of power and influence.

	Perhaps the most famous example of this tactic—the Cambridge Five—took place in Great Britain. Soviet intelligence “talent spotters” were able to recruit Cambridge University students in the 1930s—including future spy Kim Philby—who would later rise to power in the British government and become Soviet operatives during World War II and into the 1950s.

	“We believe the SVR illegals may well have hoped to do the same thing here,” said a counterintelligence agent.

	God Bless America: The Surprising History of an Iconic Song

	...A group of teenagers sang it to disrupt a Communist meeting in downtown Milwaukee park in 1941, and in 1947 war veterans broke up a Communist party rally in Bridgeport by singing "God Bless America" and the nationa anthem.

	...the song was sung by striking garment workers in Brooklyn in 1941, and by subway workers protesting a lockout in 1956. And in 1961, left-wing protestors sang it at a demonstration against the House Un-American Activities Commission in San Francisco.

	...Demonstrators in favor of Maryland's state civil rights legislation sang it on the steps of the statehouse in 1962. In 1963, protestors sang it while picketing a housing development in Torrance, California, which refused to sell homes to African Americans. And within a two-day period in early summer 1963, young African American students sang "God Bless America" at school segregation protests in Jackson, Mississippi, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana

	..."God Bless America" may have been used with a specific purpose in mind: to uphold the patriotism--and perhaps project the harmlessness-of the nonviolent protestors, pointing out that they, too, had a land that they loved, a country they hoped would be guided toward justice.

	Dewey’s influence on Dunham’s work helping craftsmen in Indonesia and Africa acquire small “micro loans” to improve their lives and their villages likely helped shape Obama’s approach to economic and foreign policy.

	While the exact nature of the Dunham file will be a topic for speculation, Kincaid said that is likely that some of the information was related to Dunham's relationship with Davis. Kincaid's ASI had previously obtained the 600-page FBI file on Davis and posted it at www.usasurvival.org It shows that Davis was a key high-level operative in a Soviet-sponsored network in Hawaii.

	Although Dunham was white, he and Davis were in many ways kindred spirits. Both were originally from Kansas. At the age of five Davis had survived an attempted lynching at the hands of a group of older white boys. 


interesting--could explain his motivations in part

	... The grandson Dunham had brought along to meet Davis represented something else that they shared, though they had experienced it from very different vantage points. The boy was the product of an unlikely union between Dunham’s only daughter, Ann, and Barack Obama Sr, a brilliant and charismatic Kenyan economics student by whom she had become pregnant at the age of 18. Within three years of their hastily arranged wedding (Barack was born less than six months later) the couple had parted, when Obama Sr – who, it emerged, already had a wife and two children back in Kenya – chose a scholarship to Harvard over his new family. 


pointing out this odd arrangement

	... ‘Barry was well-dressed, in a blazer I think,’ Weatherly-Williams said. ‘He was tired and he was hungry. He had a full face – it wasn’t pointed like it is now. We were all grinning like idiots, me and Frank and Stan, because we were thinking that we know this secret about life and we were going to share it with Barry. He hadn’t seen anyone that looked like him before.’ 

??

	... For Dunham (who had so wanted his daughter to be a boy that he had named her Stanley Ann), Barry was the son he never had. Ann Dunham believed her son could do anything, while his absent father, via letters, made clear that greatness was expected of him. Obama remarked to his biographer David Mendell, the author of Obama: from Promise to Power (2008) that ‘there was no shortage of self-esteem’.

	While his strong sense of his own worth has led to accusations of arrogance and aloofness, it also underpins Barack Obama’s star political persona. ‘Sure Barry’s got a little bit of an ego,’ said Mark Heflin, a Punahou friend. ‘To be President of the United States you’ve got to have some ego.’ 


they do this on purpose?

	Obama stood out at Punahou. Most fellow pupils were white, and although there were significant numbers of Oriental, Polynesian, Samoan and native Hawaiian children there was only a tiny handful of African-Americans. In his memoir, Obama recalled an initial ‘sense that I didn’t belong’ that continued to grow. A visit from his father when he was 10 – the first time he had seen him since he was two and the last before Barack Sr was killed in car crash in Kenya in 1982 – served only to unsettle him further. A talk by his father to his Punahou class shattered the myth Obama had carefully created that he was a young African prince whose name meant ‘Burning Spear’.


this is weird

	...Unfortunately for Obama, the Punahou coach, Chris McLachlin, was a traditionalist who emphasised the fundamentals of the game, rather than Obama’s flamboyant ‘street’ style. Obama, who protested that this was a ‘white’ method of play, was kept on the bench by McLachlin much of the time. 


is author happy about this?

	... The elegantly styled memoir, including its elisions, conflations and arguably self-serving elements, has been a main plank of Obama’s candidacy – a carefully constructed narrative that is guarded assiduously by his campaign staff. One of Obama’s closest friends told me that he could not be interviewed because he and others had been instructed to stop talking to the press. 


instructed by who, the KGB?

	Dawna Weatherly-Williams recalled how she had watched the 1974 film The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, in which an old lady and former slave describes how blacks searching for the person who would lead their people to freedom and equality would hold up babies and ask, ‘Is you the one?’ She wept as she told me, ‘I used hold up my own son and whisper that to him. But now I know it wasn’t my son who was the one – though he’s leading a happy life – but Barack.’ 


creepy. It's like its just a joke to them.

	...Weatherly-Williams pointed towards the horizon to the north, where Stanley Dunham, who had been a US Army sergeant in the Second World War, was buried in the Punchbowl National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, which overlooks Pearl Harbour, in 1992. Then she gazed to the south, towards St Louis Heights, from which Davis’s ashes had been spread five years earlier. The house on Kuhio Avenue has long since been razed and is now occupied by a multi-storey car-park. ‘I can still see it there, like a ghost,’ she said. ‘Stan felt a similar way about Barry being the one and that’s why it would be so darn cool for him to see what’s happening now. Look what you produced, Stan. I think he and Frank are up there now, cracking jokes and toasting Barack.’

	Huge death toll as terrorists crush heart of US

	Ben Fenton and Toby Harnden in Washington

	September 12 2001 12:00 AM

	...Both towers collapsed with the loss of thousands of lives, sending out great clouds of thick dust that covered buildings and people in the streets. Lower Manhattan was evacuated and the New York skyline changed forever.

	Minutes later in Washing ton DC, a third hijacked aircraft crashed into the Pentagon, the heart of America's military machine.

	...Financial centres were paralysed when Wall Street closed indefinitely and shares plunged across world markets.

	The Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Defence and the CIA were all evacuated.

	President George Bush was flown to a bunker in Nebraska.

	He pledged: "Make no mistake, we will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts."

	..."I would not want to say what the death toll could be,'' Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor, said. ``It will be a horrible number. I saw people dropping out of windows."


	...President Bush, in his address to a shocked American nation, called for calm and promised revenge on the perpetrators.

	Members of Congress spoke of the outrages against their nation as an act of war.

	Mr Bush, who was told of the attacks as he read to primary school children in Florida, said: "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless cow ard and freedom will be defended.

	"Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts."


Iraq? The Islamic world in general? Harnden might hope so

	...The attack caused jubilation in Iraq and among some radical groups in the Middle East, which saw it as revenge for America's sup port for Israel.


singles-out Iraq

	...Within hours of the attacks many government buildings throughout Amer ica, including the White House, had been closed to the public.

	Many familiar landmarks of American life closed also.

	They included the Empire State Building, the Washington monument, Disney land, the Kennedy Space Centre, the Sears Tower in Chicago, the Space Needle in Seattle.
