	Trump called for acting FBI director’s firing hours after FBI agents raided Paul Manafort’s home


http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/president-trumps-allies-turn-special-counsel-mueller/
	...Trump friend Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax, went so far as to suggest the president was already thinking about “terminating” Mueller.

	“I think he’s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel,” Ruddy said in an interview with Judy Woodruff of “PBS NewsHour.” ”I think he’s weighing that option.”

	One year into the FBI's Russia investigation, Mueller is on the Trump money trail

	Even investigative leads that have nothing to do with Russia but involve Trump associates are being referred to the special counsel to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate

	...The approach to the Manafort and Flynn probes may offer a template for how investigators' focus on possible financial crimes could help gain leverage and cooperation in the investigation.

	...The focus now for investigators is whether Manafort was involved in money laundering or tax violations in his business dealings with pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. He's also been drawn into a related investigation of his son-in-law's real estate business dealings, some of which he invested in.

	Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

	The raid also could have been intended to send a message to Trump’s former campaign chairman that he should not expect gentle treatment or legal courtesies from Mueller’s team members, who already have begun combing through Manafort’s complicated financial past.

	...The agents asked Flynn about the Kislyak calls, in part out of concern that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail over the content of the conversations. Flynn gave a wobbly explanation of events. He initially denied the sanctions discussions, then later claimed he couldn't remember.

	Senior officials who have reviewed the phone call between the two men told The Washington Post they thought Mr Flynn’s statements to Mr Kislyak were inappropriate, if not illegal, because he suggested that the Kremlin could expect a reprieve from the sanctions.

	Mr Flynn, now being investigated as part of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s involvement in the US election, has always insisted he did not discuss sanctions.

	Rep. Devin Nunes’s strange defense of Trump: He was too busy to tell Flynn to talk sanctions 

	QUESTION: But did President-elect Trump at the time of the transition team tell Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador?

	NUNES: Look, I find that — I would find that hard to believe because they were so busy, and I think these conversations were all very short.

	Trump adviser had five calls with Russian envoy on day of sanctions: sources
 
	Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for national security adviser, held five phone calls with Russia's ambassador to Washington on the day the United States retaliated for Moscow's interference in the U.S. presidential election, three sources familiar with the matter said.
 
	The calls occurred between the time the Russian embassy was told about U.S. sanctions and the announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he had decided against reprisals, said the sources.

	Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes President-elect Trump will lift the sanctions just imposed by outgoing President Obama in response to cyberattacks targeting the Democratic National Committee and other campaigns.
 
	"Considering the current transition period in Washington, we still expect that we'll be able to get rid of such clumsy actions," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, per RT, a Kremlin-funded media outlet.

	Investigators are looking both at whether financial laws were broken and whether there are any dealings that could put the President or his associates in a compromising position.

	"There's always been a concern about his exposure to blackmail in his financial dealings," says the person briefed on the investigation.

	Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no enduring financial ties to Russian interests.

	...All of those officials said Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.
 
	“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time”
 
	...On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

	In a rare, and calculated, break from the diplomatic tradition of reciprocal punishment, Putin opted to do nothing after the United States said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats and close a pair of Russian-owned properties in retaliation for Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

	...Prosecutors alleged proceeds were laundered through shell companies in Cyprus and in the United States by a criminal enterprise with strong ties to Russia and Ukraine.
 
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Harris Fischman told a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan that Vadim Trincher, 52, directed much of the international racketeering enterprise from his $5 million apartment at Trump Tower.
  
	...Trincher's apartment is located directly below one owned by Donald Trump, authorities said.

	In June 1977, an informant with the cover name “Lubos” reported that Ivana had married a man in Austria in 1968 and had worked there at a petrol station. After that, the informant claimed, she emigrated to Canada and married the American Donald Trump.
 
	The spy writes that Trump’s company is absolutely safe, economically speaking, since it receives commissions from the state. One other juicy detail: “Another advantage is the personal relationship with the American President and the fact that he is completely tax-exempt for the next 30 years.”

	Federal investigators are expected to delve into records revealing some of the President’s most closely guarded secrets, including how much money he makes, who he does business with and how reliant he is on wealthy, politically-connected foreigners.

	...Experts say Mueller’s move to follow the money has the potential to expose Trump, his family and his associates to legal troubles that go beyond election-year collusion with the Russians. It opens the door to revelations of any business-related malfeasance discovered during Mueller's look at Trump's business network.

	President Trump has sent private messages to Russia special counsel Robert Mueller

	President Trump has publicly called the widening federal investigation into Russia's election meddling a "witch hunt." But through his lawyer, Trump has sent private messages of "appreciation" to special counsel Robert Mueller.

	"He appreciates what Bob Mueller is doing,'' Trump's chief counsel John Dowd told USA TODAY in an interview Tuesday. "He asked me to share that with him and that's what I've done.''

	Trump's legal team has been in contact with Mueller's office, and Dowd says he has passed along the president's messages expressing “appreciation and greetings’’ to the special counsel.
