	UN report reveals how North Korea sources missile technology

	By Bill Gertz

	As the US ratchets up pressure on China to do more to help rein in North Korea, a UN report shows how Pyongyang uses technology smugglers and financial institutions to develop missiles and nuclear weapons.  China figures prominently in the report.

	...The report cites Chinese components and European parts acquired through China that were recovered from the debris of a North Korean missile launch. They included what the report described as an electromagnetic interference filter for a camera, pressure transmitters, and ball bearings traced to Russia.

	...a rogue team of Russian missile scientists--thrown out of work after the collapse of the Soviet Union--may have moved to North Korea. And there, for profit or glory or both, they have directed the North Korean program--with the North Koreans themselves doing little more than putting the pieces together.

	The missile experts who have been gathering evidence to support this theory phrase it in much drier terms, of course.

	"It must be concluded that various Russian companies--not necessarily the Russian government--and North Korean authorities are closely cooperating in the missile programs," wrote German missile technology specialist Robert H. Schmucker in a recent paper.

	"From these [Russian] institutions, North Korea received everything necessary to manufacture or assemble missiles. . . . The future of North Korea's work and success depends completely on the Russian involvement."

	Timothy McCarthy, senior analyst at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, says he has been quietly examining for months the possibility that some Russians are continuing to provide key components for the North Korean missiles.

	There is no evidence to suggest that the Russian government has been involved.

	Russia secretly offered North Korea nuclear technology

	Russia is facing criticism after secretly offering to sell North Korea technology that could help the rogue state to protect its nuclear stockpiles and safeguard weapons secrets from international scrutiny.

	Russian officials touted the equipment at an IT exhibition in Pyongyang a fortnight ago - just days before the Communist state caused international alarm by launching a salvo of short and long-range missiles into the Sea of Japan.

	In early August 2017, German rocket scientist Robert Schmucker published in the Deutsche Welle his opinion that North KoreaÂ´s ballistic missiles program can only exist due to transfers of Russian and Soviet rocket engines and components. Schmucker stopped short of accusing Moscow of providing Pyongyang with technology intentionally. Five days later, the New York Times published an article linking North Korea missiles to Ukrainian rocket engines.

	Observers in Kyiv believe that the Times article may be part of a targeted campaign by Russia. In an analysis published on Tuesday, the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies (CACDS) in Kyiv wrote that the US publication shows "signs of an information attack on Ukraine." Among other things, the aim of the article is apparently to divert attention from "their own missile technology shipments to North Korea" and to discredit Ukraine, especially in the eyes of the US.

	"Russia shares a border with North Korea, so one can deliver anything, even entire engines," said Mykhailo Samus, the CACDS deputy director for international affairs. Ukraine, on the other hand, would have logistical problems, he said.

	TUM's Robert Schmucker said that the latest story is about more than just the engines. "What about the missiles? The information itself is of no use; you need production facilities, technical equipment and above all, good quality control," he said. "A lot more must have come from Ukraine than just a few engines."

	...debate has broken out among missile experts about the degree of Russian involvement in producing North Korea's missiles.

	Virtually everyone agrees that, at a minimum, the North Korean program began in the 1980s with Russian help, and that the North Korean missiles are based upon Russian designs.

	...It's also undisputed that in October 1992, Russian security officials detained more than 60 Russian missile specialists at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport as they were about to leave for North Korea.

	...Some experts believe the Russian help for the North Korean missiles stopped in the early 1990s. "The paper trail ended eight years ago," says Pike.

	But others believe the Russian work has continued right up to today. They point to the Russian-style design of the North Korean missiles and to the fact that they were developed more rapidly, and with fewer flight tests, than those of other nations.

	...There also have also been some remarkable customs seizures in Europe of missile parts that North Korea was exporting, these experts say. The parts appear to be Russian. "The components bear Cyrillic markings on them," McCarthy says.
