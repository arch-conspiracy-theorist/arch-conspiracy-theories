	Person said that China's determination to establish regional hegemony, or a "zone of deference" which takes in North Korea has created confusion among Western observers about China's capacity to rein Pyongyang in. "People in Washington, including President Trump, believe China can just pick up the phone and solve the problem but because of this tortured history of relations they don't have the ability to exercise at will political influence over North Korea."

	In an interview on MSNBC that was taped Wednesday but aired Saturday, McMaster said of Pyongyang, "If they had nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States, it's intolerable from the President's perspective. Of course, we have to provide all options to do that, and that includes a military option."

	When asked by host Hugh Hewitt how concerned the American people should be about the possibility of a war with North Korea to end its nuclear threat, McMaster said Pyongyang poses an extreme danger.

	"It's impossible to overstate the danger associated with this," he said. "I think it's impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime, I mean, who murdered his own brother with nerve agent in an airport. I mean, think about what he's done, in terms of his own brutal repression of not only members of his regime but his own family."

	"The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea," he tweeted.

	HH: How concerned should the American people be that we are actually on the brink of a war with North Korea?

	HRM: Well, I think– I think it’s– it’s impossible to overstate the danger associated with this. Right, the, so I think it’s impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime, I mean, who murdered his own brother with nerve agent in a p– in– in an airport. I mean– I mean, think– think about what he’s done– in terms of his– his own brutal repression of not only members of his regime but his own family.

	HH: That’s a prison camp run by the Mafia with nuclear weapons.

	HRM: As one author has called it, it’s an “impossible state.” Right?

	HH: Or as the chief of staff said, “Just because all the choices are terrible doesn’t mean we don’t have to choose.” Will this administration choose or will it, as some people said about the last administration, “lead from behind,” when it comes to North Korea?

	HRM: Well, there’s a big difference, right? There’s a big difference in the situation that President Trump inherited from previous administrations. It’s worse. Situation’s worse. Whereas before there’s– there’s been this cycle over the years as you– as you know, from demanding that— that— that North Korea stop its missile program, stop its nuclear program. After those demands, pressure is brought on the regime. The regime then says, “Oh, I would like to talk.” And then there– then there’s long, drawn-out negotiations during which the North Korean regime continues to work on its program. And then a weak agreement is decided upon, which then North Korea immediately violates, right? Okay, so that’s, so we’re just not gonna repeat that failed cycle. We can’t do it. And so the– the, it has progressed too far as you’ve seen with these recent missile tests.

	21 May 1953

	...The Soviet Union has been exercisng supreme authority in North Korean affairs and undoubtedly makes the final policy decisions regarding North korea's role in international affairs.



https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0702/02062.html
	ALMA-ATA, KAZAKHSTAN — PARK IL PETER ALEXANDROVICH pulls out a creased brown envelope and spills out a pile of old photos and several yellowed papers. They are documentary evidence of a strange path that during the early days of the cold war brought Mr. Park to the post of personal tutor to fledgling North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung.

	...The Soviet Army had installed a puppet government in North Korea led by an obscure Korean guerrilla fighter, Kim Il Sung. For several years the Russian generals ran North Korea. During this time, Park and his secret team of Soviet Koreans played the role of the North Korean government.

	Shadow government

	"All 33 were made ministers or deputy ministers in North Korea when we arrived," Park recalls. "I was vice rector of Pyongyang University but actually I was acting rector." The nominal head was Kim Du Bong, then the No. 2 man in the North Korean regime.

	Park's origins were in the Korean community that lived across the border in the Soviet Far East. Joseph Stalin deported the Koreans to Central Asia in the late 1930s. Many of them were accused of being Japanese spies, including Park's father.

	But Park became a dedicated student of what he still calls "the science of Marx, Engels, and Lenin." As the oldest Communist Party member among them, he was made head of the Soviet Korean team, called to Moscow, and briefed on its mission by the Central Committee.

	Shortly after their arrival in Pyongyang, Park was summoned to the offices of Col. Gen. Prokophiy Romanenko, who was in charge of internal Korean affairs and was the head of the Soviet Communist Party cell there.

	Park recalls the general's words: "Petra, I am going to give you a political assignment - teach the two Kims [the two top North Korean leaders] Marxism-Leninism because they are illiterate in this. This is a party duty."

	The professor did not think much of his pupils, particularly Kim Il Sung, revered later in North Korean propaganda as the creator of his own school of Marxism. "All the theory of Marxism-Leninism - he just couldn't comprehend this," he says dismissively.

	But the Soviet Korean scholar was also given a second task - to prepare an official biography of Kim Il Sung, painting him as the leader of resistance to the Japanese. General Romanenko told him to "write a story about the heroic battle deeds performed by him in the war," Park says. He was given a document prepared by the intelligence arm of the Soviet armed forces, on which to base his account.

	Kim arrived with the Soviet Army in September 1945 wearing the uniform of a Soviet Army officer, presented to the awaiting crowds as their liberating general. In later years Kim built a cult of personality that outstrips anything attempted by Communist leaders such as Stalin and Mao Zedong. "The Great Leader," as he is officially called, is virtually credited with single-handedly defeating the Japanese.

	But Park, who extensively questioned Kim Il Sung, tells a vastly different tale. While checking the Red Army account, he found what he politely calls "discrepancies."

	"He was an ordinary person and they were trying to depict him as a hero," Park says. " `Please,' I asked him, `mention the names of Japanese officers and show me on a map the locations of battles where you defeated the Japanese.' He never answered me concretely. It was true he was a partisan, but he actually never participated in any major battles with the Japanese."

	According to Park, Kim was among a small group of Koreans who were forced over the border into the Soviet Union by a Japanese offensive in the winter of 1942. He ended up in the hands of the Soviet military, later to become part of Stalin's plan to seize part of the Japanese Empire.

	Park also lends some credence to a belief held by some Western scholars that Kim Il Sung's early political training was under Chinese Communists, even that he was a Chinese Korean in origin. Kim spoke Korean badly, Park says. "I asked him why, when you are talking to me, you think in Chinese and then translate into Korean. Does it mean you were fighting with the Chinese or that the Chinese were your teachers? He wouldn't answer."

	Fact and fable

	Park claims to have approached his task with "enthusiasm" but gradually found it difficult to reconcile the truth with the tale he was asked to construct. He decided to abandon the work.

	...General Romanenko summoned me to his office. He said, `Either you are a fool or an idiot. You could have been the first author to describe the military deeds of Kim Il Sung. A great award is awaiting you. I won't tell anyone about this incident for a few months and when you change your mind, come back, get the notebooks, and continue.' "

	But Park never went back, and it fell to Red Army intelligence to complete the job. Park fell under suspicion. "They carried out an investigation of me and found out that during the entire year, I never shouted `Long Live Gen. Kim Il Sung!' in meetings," he says. The next year he was sent home.

	"I was upset at the time, but now I thank them because Kim Il Sung would have killed me," he says with a slight smile.

	For decades, Park kept his secret. But last year he went public, traveling to Seoul to tell his remarkable tale to a more-than-eager audience. Park disdains what he calls "Russian chauvinism" and spends his time researching the exploits of the Korean people.

	"Americans, British, Russians, Chinese, Japanese - they treat us like a second rate, colonial people," he recalls telling South Koreans.

	"Of course," he adds, "they didn't expect to hear such virulent nationalism from the lips of an old Bolshevik. But they could hardly keep calm when I told them - it is exactly the position from which I was teaching Marxism-Leninism to Kim Il Sung."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung#Controversy_about_origins
	Controversy surrounds Kim's life before the founding of North Korea, with some sources labeling him an impostor. Several sources indicate that the name "Kim Il-sung" had previously been used by a prominent early leader of the Korean resistance, Kim Kyung-cheon. The Soviet officer Grigory Mekler, who worked with Kim during the Soviet occupation, said that Kim assumed this name from a former commander who had died. However, historian Andrei Lankov has argued that this is unlikely to be true.

	North Korea might be courting Russia, but China still looms larger

	May 5, 2015

	...Relations between North Korea and Russia had been looking closer in recent months. Pyongyang designated 2015 “the year of friendship with Russia,” and the media has been awash with reports of large delegations traveling in both directions and signing deals at every turn.

	There have been reports of Russian companies gaining access to North Korea’s mineral deposits in return for improving its energy sector, of Russia building a natural gas pipeline to North Korea, of a new road between the two countries and even of cooperation on projects in outer space. A recent economic agreement aims to boost annual bilateral trade to $1 billion by 2020.

	But such deals are largely symbolic, analysts say. “There’s been an abundance of talk but no walk,” said Andrei Lankov, a Russian scholar of Korea who teaches at Kookmin University in Seoul.

	Facing economic stagnation, Russia has little desire to invest in projects that will not be profitable, and it is tough to make money in North Korea. Chinese businessmen complain about the unpredictability of dealing with their counterparts in Pyongyang, and Orascom, an Egyptian company that built North Korea’s mobile network, has reportedly been unable to repatriate its profits.

	“Russia might be giving North Korea political and diplomatic support, but Russian state companies and private investors won’t do much if they can’t make money,” Lankov said.

	Georgy Kunadze, a former Russian deputy foreign minister in charge of his country’s relations with Asian nations, agreed. “This is atmospherics. It’s not substantive,” Kunadze said. “The problem has always been that North Korea has very little to offer Russia, either in economic or financial advantages or in political influence.”

	Russian smugglers are scurrying to the aid of North Korea with shipments of petroleum and other vital supplies that could help that country weather harsh new economic sanctions, U.S. officials say in an assessment that casts further doubt on whether financial measures alone can force dictator Kim Jong Un to abandon his nuclear weapons program.

	The spike in Russian exports is occurring as China — by far North Korea’s biggest trading partner — is beginning to dramatically ratchet up the economic pressure on its troublesome neighbor in the face of provocative behavior such as last week’s test of a powerful nuclear bomb.

	N Korea and Russia: A step towards a worldwide anti-hegemonic front?

	By Andrei Lankov

	...From 2005 to 2006, the North Korean leadership began to signal its displeasure with Chinese economic pre-eminence in North Korean trade. North Korean cadres were issued with classified documents that warned against excessively cosy relations with China and the Chinese. The North Korean press also began to hint at the fact that Chinese spies were operating in the country.

	Thus, North Korean diplomats have worked hard to find other possible economic partners. The need was for a country that was willing to subsidise trade with North Korea and would also be sufficiently distant from China.

	Russia changes course

	The North Korean leadership have been looking to Russia with a measure of hope since at least the early 2000s. In recent years, the official media's coverage of Russia has been remarkably positive - unlike the 1990s, when the North Korean press was full of horror stories about the chaos and suffering of Russian people. The tone changed around 2000 and Putin's policies have been presented quite favourably by the North Korean media. The North Koreans almost unconditionally welcomed the recent annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia.

	However, for a long time, the Russian government did not pay this charm offensive in Pyongyang much attention.

	Rachkovsky was a pioneer. He refined the art of what we today call active measures or perceptions management techniques. He paid subsidies to journalists willing to write articles favorable to Russian interests, and he purchased or subsidized such periodicals as Revue Russe and Le Courier Franco-Russe. During his tenure (1884-1902), journalists on the Okhrana payroll began planting articles in the French press that were favorable to Russian interests. Rachkovsky also created the Ligue pour le Salut de la Patrie Russe, which promoted positive views toward Russia among French citizens; this group was a forerunner of Soviet front organizations and "friendship societies."


https://www.gwern.net/docs/terrorism/1989-andrew.pdf
    Like much else in the study of contemporary intelligence, KGB and GRU foreign operations are commonly interpreted with almost total disregard for historical perspective. "Active measures" are widely believed to be an invention of Soviet intelligence. In reality, though the KGB has been responsible for an enormous expansion in the use made of them, their effectiveness was at least as great in tsarist times. There is no convincing evidence that any KGB-inspired press campaign in the West as been as effective as the tsarist attempting to persuade Western investors, all of whom later lost their money, to ignore the risks of investing in Russia. Before World War I, every Paris newspaper of note save for the socialist L'Humanite was successfully bribed to support tsarist government loans. By 1914, 25 percent of France's foreign investment was in Russia

	But most Russian foreign policy officials and analysts argue that the only realistic option for defusing the crisis would be a deal granting North Korea the status of a de facto nuclear power similar to that of India and Pakistan — without formal recognition, but without attempts to disarm it either.

	“Instead of chasing an impossible and unachievable goal of a non-nuclear North Korea, the US and other interested parties should quietly switch to a less pleasant, but realistically achievable goal: North Korea with small and stable nuclear arsenal,” Andrei Lankov, a Russian professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, wrote in a commentary on the options for resolving the crisis.

	Mr Sukhinin said: “North Korea’s goal is to make everyone accept, even if not officially, that it has nuclear weapons now — just like India, Pakistan and Israel. They want to achieve such a status.”

	Kim Jong Un Is a Survivor, Not a Madman

	By Andrei Lankov

	As a guide for understanding North Korea, this analysis is just plain wrong. As a guide for crafting policy toward Pyongyang, it may be catastrophic. North Korea’s system might look bizarre to us from the outside, but the Kims are the ultimate political survivors, hard-edged rationalists whose actions have always had a clear purpose: keeping the family in power. Seeing them as madmen is not only wrong, but also dangerous; any successful policy should be based on understanding the logic of the opposite side, not on discarding it as “irrational”

	Is Russia Sightless or Is It Mimicking Blind: Researcher of Institute for International Studies

	...The DPRK's ICBM, a noble fruition of its great policy of simultaneously developing the economic construction and the building of nuclear force, is clearly recorded in space as a pronoun of defence of international justice and peace, both in name and reality.

	But only Russia is making a far-fetched assertion, denying this stark fact unanimously acknowledged by the world community, while feigning blind and deaf.

	Russia, a country bordering the Korean peninsula, is calling the DPRK's ICBM a medium-range ballistic rocket with 681 km of height and 732 km of distance. This is utterly ironical.

	...The U.S., situated in the American continent across the ocean, dares not deny the fact even though it is reluctant more than others to acknowledge the DPRK's success in the ICBM launch. A big question is how come the ICBM of the DPRK is taken as medium-range ballistic rocket by Russia, a country very close to the DPRK.

	Another question is that Russia, which will be grouchy if it is ranked second in military standings, is making desperate efforts to make its far-fetched assertions sound plausible while misusing even the name of the Defence Ministry.

	...However, Russia, which had showed bravery as if it was going to hinder the adoption of the "resolution sanctions" on the DPRK, boarded the ship operated by the U.S. all of a sudden to be "complimented" by Trump. This is quite enough for the world to guess what was the true aim sought by Russia in insisting that the ICBM of the DPRK was a medium-range ballistic rocket.

	The far-fetched assertion of Russia has become an engine that heartened the DPRK to work for more launches of ICBM and compelled it to take new measures of action.

	It will be clear to Russia itself whether it is really the blind or is feigning the blind.

	Nukes of Aggression Generate Access to Nuclear Weapons of Justice: KCNA Commentary

	Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- 59 years has passed since the U.S. shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea.

	The U.S. officially announced on Jan. 29, 1958 that it deployed Honest John nuclear missiles in south Korea and opened to public the deployed nuclear weapons in February that year.

	Since then, it has systematically increased the number of nuclear weapons in south Korea over the past nearly 60 years, reaching more than 1 000 in the 1970s and more than 1720 in the 1990s.

	The U.S. nukes deployed in south Korea are means of aggression and domination to stifle the DPRK and conquer the whole world from A to Z.


http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/world/us-to-pull-a-bombs-from-south-korea.html
	WASHINGTON, Oct. 19— The United States plans to withdraw all nuclear bombs from South Korea, Administration officials said today. Coming on top of cuts in nuclear missiles and artillery shells announced by President Bush last month, the new move would mean no nuclear weapons would remain in that country.


https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1486472557-727120430/nukes-of-aggression-generate-access-to-nuclear-weapons-of-justice-kcna-commentary/
	Pursuant to the policy, it declared the start of equipping its forces present in south Korea with nukes in July 1957 and stepped up the forward deployment of nuclear weapons and thus turned south Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East.

	It set the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack and has modified and supplemented the scenarios for a nuclear war against the DPRK time and again and made them more criminal in their contents and has ceaselessly developed them through anti-DPRK war drills with the puppet forces every year.

	Shortly ago, the U.S. promised the south Korean puppet forces that it would stage Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises targeting the DPRK in the largest scale.

	It is the mastermind of a nuclear war hell-bent on imposing a nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation and an arch criminal that spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.

	The daily-escalating U.S. nuclear pressure on the DPRK compelled the latter to counter the nukes with its own nukes as its last option and have access to even the ultra-modern strategic strike means such as smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads as well as H-bomb.

	The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons markedly reduced the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and replaced the era of nukes of aggression, in which the U.S. unilaterally posed nuclear threat, with an era of nukes of justice in which the hostile forces can never have a sound sleep.

	North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed at least five senior officials in the country's Ministry of State Security using antiaircraft guns, the head of South Korea's intelligence services told lawmakers on Monday.

	The execution, which was punishment for unspecified "false reports" that were made to Mr. Kim


http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628
	Mr Kim made his first public speech as North Korea marked the 100th anniversary of the birthday of founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April 2012, praising the "military first" doctrine and vowing the time his nation could be threatened was "forever over".

	"Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolised by imperialists," he said, adding: "We have to make every effort to reinforce the people's armed forces."

	...In world politics, however, Kim Jong-un is still regarded as an unknown quantity. He has not travelled abroad in an official capacity since taking power, in contrast to his father who made several visits to China.

	Domestically, his repeated replacement of defence ministers - there have been at least six men in the post since 2011 - is seen by some analysts as an indication of Mr Kim's lack of confidence in the loyalty of the armed forces.

	And the most high-profile indication of a possible power struggle within the North Korean elite came in December 2013, when Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of his uncle Chang Song-thaek. State media said he had been plotting a coup.

	Mr Kim is also widely believed to have ordered the murder of his exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in February 2017 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.


http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/06/23/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-uses-terrifyingly-creative-methods-to-kill-enemies.html
	According to a report from the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean think tank, Kim has ordered the execution of more than 340 individuals since taking power in 2011. The report also indicates that the number of military and government officials purged by Kim since 2011 has increased every year. Just 3 officials were executed in 2012, compared to about 140 since the beginning of 2016.


http://www.newsweek.com/kim-jong-un-russian-spies-protection-655308
	Kim Jong Un has taken his personal protection to a new level. Japanese media reported Friday that the North Korean dictator, who already only travels at night out of fear of attack, has linked up with 10 former KGB agents to avoid assassination.

	A source told the Asahi Shimbun that Kim reached out to the ex-members of the Russian secret intelligence agency in February. They came to Pyongyang as military advisers to give advice to Kim’s guards on how to handle threats—including those that may come from the U.S. The outlet also speculated that the former KGB agents may be helping the North Korean government weed out spies there.

	Room 39 (or Office 39) is the primary government organization that seeks ways to maintain the foreign currency slush fund of North Korea's leader. Room 39 oversees many of the government's illegal activities (although the military also has its own illegal activity division) such as counterfeiting and drug production. In 2010, the department was reported to have had 17 overseas branches, 100 trading companies and banks under its control. By 2009, the office allegedly had upwards of $5 billion in assets, much of which was spread in banks throughout Macau, Hong Kong, and Europe.

	In August 2014, Yun Tae Hyong, a senior representative of North Korea's Korea Daesong Bank, which is suspected of being under control of Room 39, was reported to have defected to Russia taking $5 million with him.

	On 5 May 2013, North Korea "grabbed," according to Jiang Yaxian, a Chinese government official, another Chinese fishing boat in a series of impounding Chinese fishing boats. "North Korea was demanding 600,000 yuan ($97,600) for its safe return, along with its 16 crew."

	...In March 2016 the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a missile factory, which China strongly condemned, in a report by the state newspaper the People's Daily revealed that the North Korean politics causes instability on the Korean Peninsula and is comparable to the situation in Syria.

	North Korea's Kim Jong Un uses terrifyingly creative methods to kill enemies

	...Perhaps the most frightening method of execution ordered by the 33-year-old, third-generation dictator is allowing a pack of starving dogs to devour enemies. In one notable case, the victim was purportedly Kim's own uncle.

	Jang Song-thaek was thought of as a father figure to Kim Jong Un, and served as the second-in-command to the supreme leader. But when he ran afoul of Kim in 2013 for "anti-state acts" and "double-dealing," his familial ties couldn't save him from his nephew's wrath.

	How Jang died may never come to light, but a rumor that he was fed to dogs was widely reported. Other reports subsequently claimed that Jang was likely executed by anti-aircraft guns before his body was incinerated by flamethrowers.

	The gout-addled Kim also had several of his uncle's cronies killed, and was reportedly "very drunk" when he gave the orders.

Intelligence from the United States, following its failure to intervene to prevent the Communist victory in China, indicated, he believed, that ‘the prevailing mood is not to interfere’ in Korea. That erroneous conclusion seems to have been based on his misinterpretation of a US National Security Council document (probably supplied by the KGB agent Donald Maclean), which excluded the Asian mainland from the American defence perimeter.

	To provide for the regime’s future, Kim Il-sung made the myth that gave him personal legitimation also the basis of a new dynasty. He probably feared, as Lankov speculates, being rushed off the stage by his designated successor in the way that, for example, Lin Biao had recently been accused of doing to Mao in China. The only person unlikely to be tempted to overthrow him was his son, whose own survival would depend on the robustness of his father’s myth. The younger Kim’s birth year was altered from 1941 to 1942 to rhyme with his father’s birth year of 1912. His official birthplace was moved from its actual location in Siberia, where the Korean Communists were hiding out during the war, to a mythical secret revolutionary military camp on the snow-capped sacred Mount Paektu inside Japanese-occupied Korea. And the story of his youth was retroactively packed with demonstrations of resoluteness and virtue.

	Putin ally celebrates winning 98 percent of vote in a full suit of medieval armor 

	Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Russian republic of Chechnya, marked his landslide reelection this weekend in a manner that somehow seemed befitting.

	To no one's surprise, he was ahead with about 98 percent of the vote after a partial count of ballots from the Sunday election was announced. Rights groups accuse Kadyrov, in power since 2007, of ruling the Muslim-majority republic with an iron fist as a loyal lieutenant of Russian President Vladimir Putin. In 2011 parliamentary elections, about 99.48 percent of Chechnya's vote went to Putin's ruling United Russia party. Their relationship is not dissimilar to that of a feudal lord and his vassal.

	EUROPE : Chechnya Summons Uneasy Memories in Former East Bloc : Ex-Soviet satellites look warily on the Russian offensive. Their fears create a new urgency for membership in NATO.

	WARSAW — The Russian offensive in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has left the world unsettled. But nowhere has it rattled more nerves than in Eastern and Central Europe.

	Client states or subject republics of the former Soviet Union until a few years ago, Russia's western neighbors have watched the bloodshed through the lens of their own troubled past.

	Their view is framed by half a century of repression, which led to Soviet troops crushing unrest.

	Newsflash: Russia Is Not the Soviet Union

	Doug Bandow

	...Russia has behaved badly toward Georgia and Ukraine, but that poses no security issue for America or even Europe. Would Washington and Brussels prefer peace and tranquility? Of course. However, the U.S. and Europe remain prosperous and secure despite the hardship visited by Moscow upon its neighbors. The fact that Washington does not approve of Russia’s behavior doesn’t make Russia a security threat or turn Russia into America’s number one enemy. Washington should not let its humanitarian sympathies dictate security policy.

	How Chechnya Became a Breeding Ground for Terror

	...Al-Qaeda Adopts the Chechen Cause

	Foreign fighters did not have a significant presence in the first Chechen war, which started soon after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and ended with the November 1996 Russian retreat and the creation of an autonomous Chechen government led by the late Aslan Maskhadov. The main Chechen rebel leader during the first war, Dzhokhar Dudayev, had a generally secular nationalist outlook. According to Alexander Iskanderyan, director of the Center for Caucasian Studies in Moscow, "the Chechen independence movement had no Islamic dimension at all." But when the conflict began to attract media coverage, Islamic jihadis migrated to Chechnya.

	Over the last decade, Islamist terrorists have co-opted the Chechen cause as part of a global jihad. Umar Ibn al-Khattab, a Saudi native who became the leader of the foreign mujahideen in Chechnya, said, "This case is not just a Chechen matter but an Islamic matter, like Afghanistan."

	Mohammed Al-Saud is under no illusions. “In 2011, the majority of the current ISIS leadership was released from jail by Bashar Al Assad,” he said. “No one in the regime has ever admitted this, or explained why.” Al-Saud, a Syrian dissident with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, left Syria under threat of arrest in 2011.

	When Trump Met Putin: Is Reconciliation in the Air?

	Doug Bandow

	...the United States wants to overthrow Assad, defeat ISIS, empower the half dozen “moderates” still to be found among the insurgents, work with the Kurdish militias, avoid offending the Turks, get the squabbling Sunni Gulf states to do more, create a liberal political order like those established in Afghanistan and Iraq—or not—and avoid getting into a war with Russia. The first would chiefly empower the bad guys, the second is almost done, the third is futile, the fourth is coming to a conclusion, the fifth isn’t worth the effort, the sixth is hopeless (just like the seventh) and the eighth is really important. The best way to achieve the last one is to simply leave and allow the Russians and regional powers to cope with the mess.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Bandow
	Douglas "Doug" Bandow (born c. 1954) is an American political writer, currently working as a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute. In 2005, Bandow was forced to resign from the Cato Institute after it was revealed that for over ten years, he accepted payments in exchange for publishing articles favorable to various clients. Bandow referred to these activities as "a lapse of judgment"

	...Bandow regularly writes on military non-interventionism and is a vociferous critic of NATO enlargement.

	...During the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Bandow described Ukraine as a "fake country" where “there’s nothing at stake” for the U.S., and suggested that Russia should be allowed to exert influence there. Since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, Bandow continued to author opinion pieces on why the U.S. should not help Ukraine against Russia.
