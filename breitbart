	Black Lives Matter Activists Respond to Trump Victory with Fear, Violence, Resolve

	Black Lives Matter activists expressed shock, anger, fear, and defiance on social media after the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States, demonstrating that the radical leftists behind the Black Lives Matter movement view the election as a setback but far from the end of their work in dividing the country.

	Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage

	...The American left is in a feeding frenzy, cynically exploiting the tragic murders of nine black worshippers in a Charleston church to promote its agenda of cultural genocide against conservatism, tradition and the South.

	...Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans has called for a debate over the future of a statue in the city of Robert E. Lee and the renaming of a roundabout called Lee Circle to “reflect who we are as a people”

	...the culture warriors of the left cannot be appeased by any concession: they rightly interpret it as weakness and demand more. Those who initiated identity politics are attempting to obliterate the Southern identity. There is only one response: defiance. Every tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag.

	...Originally billed as a protest in favour of free speech — alongside the disdain over the removal of Confederate statues in the city — the “alt-right” rally found itself transformed into a torch-wielding, Nazi-flag waving dereliction of American values — at least considering the publicity afforded to the event, and the behaviour of some of the rally’s attendees.

	...In the mid afternoon — after protesters were run over by a car, leaving one dead — stick-wielding left-wing activists roamed the streets aimlessly in groups of four or five. One such group screamed: “F**k Donald Trump,” as a girl — clearly unrelated to either side — walked past them.

	...The media tone is also evidently one-sided. While no one — including this website — would take up the cause of defending the actions of the alt right or Nazi flag wavers

	Doug McKelway: Alt-Right Fights Fire With Fire, and Engages in Legitimate ‘Activism’

	Fox News correspondent Doug McKelway argued that the Alt-Right has been unfairly portrayed on Wednesday’s “America’s Newsroom.”

	McKelway said the media likes to feature the Alt-Right “as a mob of unruly, racist, bigoted, sexist, uneducated white males, who have been unleashed.” And that many conservatives, Ben Shapiro have critical views of the Alt-Right, but that the movement is “much more” than bigotry, and some if it is reflected in the activism of Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos crusades against campus political correctness, and that the Alt-Right often fights “fire with fire.”

	Not for the first time, Hillary Clinton is about to dive into a topic she doesn’t understand. In an attempt to frame Donald Trump as a dangerous extremist and panderer to racists, she is going to take on the alternative right.

	The move is purely cynical of course. Breitbart is the only major news site that has illuminating coverage to the alt-right, exploring its effect on the 2016 election without simple-minded denunciation or endorsement.

	An Establishment Conservative’s Guide To The Alt-Right

	by Allum Bokhari & Milo Yiannopoulos

	The origins of the alternative right can be found in thinkers as diverse as Oswald Spengler, H.L Mencken, Julius Evola, Sam Francis, and the paleoconservative movement that rallied around the presidential campaigns of Pat Buchanan.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Spengler
	In addition, Spengler's chief racial doctrine of the "coloured" menace was undermining Germany's relations with her natural ally—Japan. Nevertheless, 200,000 copies of the book had been sold in Germany as of 1934.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken
	Mencken opposed American entry into World War I and World War II. His diary indicates that he was a racist and privately used coarse language and slurs to describe various ethnic and racial groups. Mencken also at times seemed to show a genuine enthusiasm for militarism, though never in its American form. "War is a good thing," he once wrote


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Evola
	...Evola has been described as "one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history."

	...In the epilogue to this text Evola argued that the Protocols of Zion, regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Francis
	A white nationalist, Francis was a columnist and editor for the conservative Washington Times, but was fired from the newspaper after making racist remarks at the 1995 conference of the American Renaissance.

	Is Putin the ‘Preeminent Statesman’ of Our Times?

	Pat Buchanan

	Putin stands against the Western progressive vision of what mankind’s future ought to be. Years ago, he aligned himself with traditionalists, nationalists and populists of the West, and against what they had come to despise in their own decadent civilization.

	What they abhorred, Putin abhorred. He is a God-and-country Russian patriot. He rejects the New World Order established at the Cold War’s end by the United States. Putin puts Russia first.

	After the Confederates, Who’s Next?

	Pat Buchanan

	...But today’s America is not the magnanimous country we grew up in.

	Since the ’60s, there has arisen an ideology that holds that the Confederacy was the moral equivalent of Nazi Germany and those who fought under its battle flag should be regarded as traitors or worse.

	Thus, in New Orleans, statues of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, and General Robert E. Lee were just pulled down.

	How I Saw the Light About Race (Part V)

	...Stories of white identity and black hostility.

	One afternoon as I dozed off, I was startled by clouds of acrid smoke rising from the floor next to me. There, squatted next to my neighbor’s bed, was a grotesque semi-naked figure, festooned in rattling cowry shells, with shriveled eagle talons and tortoise shells, dried snakes and feathers strung around his scrawny neck, a starkly white painted face, arms and legs covered in red and blue ochre smears, a jockstrap pulled tight between his wasted thighs.

	I reached for the nurses’ bell, and minutes later the black supervisor arrived.

	I had a litany of complaints: violating sterility, general unhygienic practice, anthrax from dead wild animals, stench, danger of open fires near oxygen tanks, rampant bacteria. . . .

	The supervisor archly reminded me that “traditional medicine” was now officially legalized. Witchdoctors (now called healers) routinely called on and treated their patients in well-equipped first-world facilities.

	My complaint was dismissed as “racist and unconstitutional.”

	That was the moment I graduated from being a long-suffering, silent, liberal-minded white South African to a firm believer in racial reality.

	...For decades, the concerns of those who cherish western culture have been openly ridiculed and dismissed as racist. The alt-right is the inevitable result. No matter how silly, irrational, tribal or even hateful the Establishment may think the alt-right’s concerns are, they can’t be ignored, because they aren’t going anywhere. As Haidt reminds us, their politics is a reflection of their natural inclinations.

	In other words, the Left can’t language-police and name-call them away, which have for the last twenty years been the only progressive responses to dissent, and the Right can’t snobbishly dissociate itself from them and hope they go away either.

	...If you’re this far down the article, you’ll know some of the answers already. For the meme brigade, it’s just about having fun. They have no real problem with race-mixing, homosexuality, or even diverse societies: it’s just fun to watch the mayhem and outrage that erupts when those secular shibboleths are openly mocked.

	Anti-White Racism: The Hate That Dares Not Speak Its Name

	by David Horowitz

	...This progressive assault is being waged in the name of an “identity politics” that places whites at the bottom of the racial totem pole while holding them responsible for all the sins attributed to Americans but none of their achievements

	...But even as progressives prosecute this race war, racial bigotry by whites has ceased to be a factor in public life. Progressives deal with this intractable reality by inventing a fictional construct called “institutional racism” to which they attribute all the disparities affecting blacks.

	...The statement that 2016 America is a “white supremacist” nation is not only the reflection of a deranged hatred for whites, but an act of hostility towards black America, whose opportunities and rights in this country are greater than in any other under the sun, including every African nation and Caribbean country governed by blacks for hundreds and even thousands of years.

	...Black Lives Matter – a driving force behind the white supremacist meme – is a roving lynch mob whose premise is the claim that a systematic war is being waged on black people. This claim is deployed to justify riots in the streets, the burning of cities and open incitements to kill police.

	...it is true that blacks are being gunned down in numbers far out of proportion to their representation in the population. But the truth Black Lives Matter racists want to obscure is that almost all of those black homicide victims were gunned down by black killers. It is not whites who are gunning down blacks in the streets but other blacks.

	...the corruptions of a “liberal” culture, which condemns invisible white racism while defending black criminals who prey on the minority inhabitants of America’s inner cities. A principal source of the war on white people generally and law enforcement in particular is our leftwing university and literary culture, which for forty years has taught college students that it is politically correct to hate white people

	Concluding the slide, MILO quoted the words of the lawmaker and Sheriff Clarke as the best description of the movement.

	...The bulk of their demands, after all, are not so audacious: they want their own communities, populated by their own people, and governed by their own values.

	In short, they want what every people fighting for self-determination in history have ever wanted, and what progressives are always telling us people should be allowed — unless those people are white. This hypocrisy is what has led so many Trump voters — groups who have in many cases not voted since the 1970s or 80s — to come out of the woodwork and stand up for their values and culture.

	The Establishment need to read their Haidt and realise that this group isn’t going away. There will be no “progress” that erases the natural affinities of conservatives. We can no longer pretend that divides over free trade and the minutiae of healthcare reform really represent both sides of the political spectrum in America. The alt-right is here, and here to stay.

	Coincidence? 

	It was during Andropov’s dictatorship that President Ronald Reagan instituted many of the policies that brought down the Soviet Union. This included branding them the Evil Empire, initiating SDI, installing Pershing-II missiles in Europe, and the outright liberation of one of the Kremlin’s chess pieces (Grenada). All of which showed the Kremlin that the days of messing with the free world were over.

It's their right, under free speech, to say these kinds of things, even if it leads to acts of violence. But there is one problem: have they registered as agents of the Russian Federation?

The media is how people learn about the world; it shapes their worldview. Americans need to know that their media is lying to them.

In the '60s, Americans rallied to change our laws so that everybody had equal rights. The most effective way we can fight racism today is to throw out foreign influence.
