	Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.

	...Investigators, the officials said, have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia’s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system

	This report includes an analytic assessment drafted and coordinated among The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and The National Security Agency (NSA)

	...We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.  We have high confidence in these judgments.

	We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment

	Some Democrats, however, saw the episode as fresh evidence of problems at the Central Intelligence Agency. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, said the ''tragic consequences,'' coupled with intelligence failures in Iraq, were grounds for Mr. Tenet's removal.

	C.I.A. WAS GIVEN DATA ON HIJACKER LONG BEFORE 9/11

	By JAMES RISEN and ERIC LICHTBLAU FEB. 24, 2004

	...Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the C.I.A., F.B.I. and other government agencies have been heavily criticized for failing to put together fragmentary pieces of information they received from a wide array of sources in order to predict or prevent the terrorist plot. The joint Congressional panel that investigated the attacks concluded that American authorities ''missed opportunities to disrupt the Sept. 11 plot by denying entry to or detaining would-be hijackers; to at least try to unravel the plot through surveillance and other investigative work within the United States; and finally, to generate a heightened state of alert and thus harden the homeland against attack.''




Trying to blame 9/11 on the CIA

	“Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” The CIA’s famous Presidential Daily Brief, presented to George W. Bush on August 6, 2001, has always been Exhibit A in the case that his administration shrugged off warnings of an Al Qaeda attack. But months earlier, starting in the spring of 2001, the CIA repeatedly and urgently began to warn the White House that an attack was coming.

	THE question in Washington is not whether the intelligence community will be overhauled, but how, after fresh evidence last week that the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. had missed major warning signs about the Sept. 11 attacks.

	The commission investigating the attacks disclosed that intelligence officials were warned in the summer of 2001 that Osama bin Laden was ''planning high-profile attacks'' and that George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, had received a briefing that August titled ''Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly,'' about the arrest days earlier of Zacarias Moussaoui. Attorney General John Ashcroft was also portrayed as being inattentive to terrorism before the attacks -- a charge he heatedly denied.

	Commissioners said the intelligence community's failure to share and act on such information would prompt them to consider major structural changes, including the creation of a national intelligence czar over the C.I.A. and the restructuring of the F.B.I. The White House has signaled that it is considering reforms of its own.

	...The charges made public on Thursday do not say the information was classified, but the official cautioned, “We don’t necessarily know at this point everything that was passed.”

	But an intelligence official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity played down the threat, noting that Mr. Nicholson had not been in the C.I.A. since 1996. “This just shows that the Russians are either sentimental or stupid,” the official said.

	WASHINGTON — For more than a decade, questions have lingered about the possible role of the Saudi government in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, even as the royal kingdom has made itself a crucial counterterrorism partner in the eyes of American diplomats.

	Now, in sworn statements that seem likely to reignite the debate, two former senators who were privy to top secret information on the Saudis’ activities say they believe that the Saudi government might have played a direct role in the terrorist attacks.

	“I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,” former Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said in an affidavit filed as part of a lawsuit brought against the Saudi government and dozens of institutions in the country by families of Sept. 11 victims and others. Mr. Graham led a joint 2002 Congressional inquiry into the attacks.

	His former Senate colleague, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democrat who served on the separate 9/11 Commission, said in a sworn affidavit of his own in the case that “significant questions remain unanswered” about the role of Saudi institutions. “Evidence relating to the plausible involvement of possible Saudi government agents in the September 11th attacks has never been fully pursued,” Mr. Kerrey said.

	WASHINGTON — The Justice Department charged Friday that a former State Department analyst and his wife worked as spies for Cuba for nearly 30 years, using a short-wave radio to pass on secret diplomatic information to their Cuban handlers.

	Officials said the couple, Walter K. Myers, 72, and Gwendolyn S. Myers, 71, received little in the way of compensation from the Cubans except for the short-wave radio and some travel expenses. Rather, the officials said, the couple appears to have been driven by their strong affinity for Cuba and their bitterness toward “American imperialism.”

	“We think they did it because they love Cuba,” said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case.


http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071600684.html
	Starting in 1978, however, the recently divorced Myers visited Cuba for two weeks and was soon recruited by a Cuban intelligence agent. When Myers spent a two-year sabbatical in South Dakota, where he was living with then-Gwendolyn Trebilcock, the agent met Myers again, and he agreed to become a spy.
