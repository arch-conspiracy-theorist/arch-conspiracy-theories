	President Donald Trump on Friday said he would not rule out a "military option" in Venezuela as the ruling regime there consolidates power.

	"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary," Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday. 


http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/346282-trump-refused-phone-call-from-venezuelan-president
	"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of their continued oppression by the Maduro regime," she added. "President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country." 

	Trump said Friday that he had not ruled out possible military action in Venezuela in response to growing political and social turmoil in the country.

	It is not clear if Maduro requested the phone call with Trump before or after the president's remarks. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately return The Hill's request for comment.

	Shortly after Trump raised the possibility of a military solution in Venezuela Friday, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that it hadn't received orders regarding Venezuela.

	Obama team was warned in 2014 about Russian interference

	In 2014, the administration got a report of Russia’s intention to disrupt Western democracies, including the United States.

	By ALI WATKINS

	08/14/2017 05:04 AM EDT 

	As early as 2014, the administration received a report that quoted a well-connected Russian source as saying that the Kremlin was building a disinformation arm that could be used to interfere in Western democracies. The report, according to an official familiar with it, included a quote from the Russian source telling U.S. officials in Moscow, "You have no idea how extensive these networks are in Europe ... and in the U.S., Russia has penetrated media organizations, lobbying firms, political parties, governments and militaries in all of these places."


sound extensive


	...There was no explicit warning of a threat to U.S. elections, but the official said some diplomats and national security officials in Moscow felt the administration was too quick to dismiss the possibility that the Kremlin incursions could reach the United States.

	“Even if the Russians and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin had these ambitions, they were doubtful of their capacity to execute them,” the official said of the Obama administration.


Obama played down

	...On Oct. 7, 2016, about a month before the election, the administration revealed, through a statement from the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, that the U.S. government believed Russia was behind the hacks and was seeking to interfere with the election. The revelation, which many in the White House expected to be bombshell news, was largely overshadowed by the revelation that same day of an “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald Trump made crude and sexist comments to anchor Billy Bush.


Funny, they timed that?

say NSC, State dep didn't want to do anything about it

	...“The idea of having Kerry doing it with Lavrov was raised several times and he didn’t want to do it,” the NSC official said.

	The president was not alone in his pleasure at the news conference. Chief strategist Steve Bannon, whose nationalistic views helped shape Trump’s presidential campaign, was thrilled with the remarks, according to a friend of Bannon. Even though Trump on Tuesday failed to offer full-throated confidence in Bannon, saying, “We’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,” the controversy has brought some additional job security for the strategist, who has been on the outs with Trump and other White House aides.


What is Bannon thinking? Trump can't take any more hits and firing him would be one?

or would firing Bannon improve Trump's image?

	..."Pathetic. Just pathetic, isn't it?" Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on NBC’s “Today” show.

	"This is terrible. The president of the United States needs to condemn these kinds of hate groups," Kasich added. "The president has to totally condemn this. It's not about winning an argument."

Why did Peter Strzok leav Meuller's team?


http://www.businessinsider.com/top-fbi-investigator-peter-strzok-steps-away-from-russia-probe-2017-8
	A top FBI investigator has unexpectedly stepped away from special counsel Mueller's Russia probe

	Natasha Bertrand 

	...Peter Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence investigator, is now working for the FBI's human resources division, according to ABC. It is unclear why he stepped aside, or if he did so voluntarily.

	Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent and associate dean at Yale Law School, said that she had "never heard of an agent being moved to the human resources department."

	"I have seen instances where if some issue comes up, the agent might be moved to another investigation or to the operations center, where you essentially field calls all day," Rangappa said. "But why he would be moved to HR is just bizarre." 

	...Strzok headed the FBI's counterespionage division and was one of the top officials overseeing the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information while she was secretary of state. He had previously worked on some of the "most secretive investigations in recent years involving Russian and Chinese espionage," according to the New York Times. 

	... Strzok's departure also came one week after The Washington Post reported that Mueller had obtained a search warrant to raid the home of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The Post report cited "people familiar with the search," prompting questions about whether anyone on Mueller's team had leaked the existence of the search warrant to the Post.

	Russia supports the far-right in Europe. What about here?

	WASHINGTON

	Moscow announced plans Thursday to shut down an American neo-Nazi website that moved to a Russian domain after being booted earlier in the week from its U.S. web address.

	It was a smart public move, but behind the scenes, Russia’s interactions with far-right movements are far friendlier. Indeed, they have been supportive.

	In Poland, police recently arrested a man believed to be a spy for Russian intelligence who was also known to work closely with far-right political parties in Germany and Poland. In France, far-right nationalist and anti-immigrant political party, the National Front, has been widely reported to receive millions in financial support from Russia.

	And in Hungary in 2016, after a shootout ended with police arresting a 76-year-old Hungarian National Front member, police explained that his group had been working with Russian intelligence officers who went so far as to set up mock combat exercises for training.


	...Given Russia’s twin goals of convincing its own population that the West is not worth emulating and weakening foreign organizations it sees as a threat, officials in NATO, Europe and the United States are now wondering whether Russia is somehow linked to American extremists.

	“There is a clear ideological link between American white supremacists and the European far-right,” Curika said. “Ideological support, that is easily seen. The money is more difficult to trace.”

	Certainly, U.S. groups interact with the European far-right groups that Russia is reported to financially support.

	Peter Kreko, the director of the Political Capital Institute in Budapest, said finding the tracks of Russian support to America is quite difficult. The fact that they swiftly booted The Daily Stormer out of their internet space indicates they want to avoid, at least, public support of American hate groups.

	As federal investigators probe possible Kremlin links with the Donald Trump campaign, one connection that hasn’t gotten much attention is that between Jared Kushner and one of Russia’s most powerful and influential billionaires: Roman Abramovich.  

	...“There’s no oligarch among those still accepted in the West who’s closer and more trusted by Putin than Abramovich,” Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil magnate who’s now a London-based Kremlin opponent and no friend of Abramovich’s, said in an interview. A spokesman for Abramovich called the relationship with Putin “formal and professional.”

	Watching television in Peru and Argentina, I was amazed to see how Trump’s Aug. 11 remark that “I’m not ruling out a military option” in Venezuela has changed the conversation about the Venezuelan crisis in the region. Latin America’s most influential media, which until recently were focusing on Maduro’s break with constitutional law, are now talking about the history of U.S. interventions in Latin America.

	And Maduro is making the most of it: He now makes his public speeches in front of a huge banner reading, “Trump, get out of Latin America!” And he uses Trump’s statement as alleged evidence that the Venezuelan regime is a victim of “U.S. imperialism.”

	...In fact, Trump’s remarks have already done more harm than allowing Maduro to shift the conversation away from his power grab. They have also fractured Latin America’s diplomatic front that was putting growing pressure on the Maduro regime to restore democratic rule.

	...Top Peruvian diplomats told me that the group of more than a dozen Latin American countries that met in Peru earlier this month to discuss the Venezuelan crisis is now divided over whether to adopt stronger diplomatic sanctions against Maduro, because several countries are reluctant to go forward amid the threat of a U.S. military intervention.

	...In addition, Trump’s remarks may have helped deflate recent street protests in Venezuela. Some regime opponents who have been fooled into believing in an imminent U.S. invasion are now holed up in their homes, waiting for a U.S. military intervention that will most likely never materialize.

	Many Venezuelans who are pinning their hopes on Trump’s “military option” argue that most Venezuelans would applaud one.

	But that’s not the point. The point is that whether you’re for or against it — and I’m against it — it’s unrealistic to expect it to happen.

	3 Questions About A Pro-Russia Congressman's Meeting With Julian Assange

	A member of Congress who's one of the staunchest defenders of Russia in American politics met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London on Wednesday.

	...The congressman and WikiLeaks founder also discussed "possibilities" that would allow Assange to leave the embassy where international diplomatic protections have kept him from being arrested, Rohrabacher spokesman Ken Grubbs told NPR.

	Rohrabacher plans to "divulge more of what he found directly to President Trump," he said in a statement.


this sounds sketchy


	...Rohrabacher claims to have lost a drunken arm wrestling match to Putin in the early '90s at a bar in downtown Washington after a game of touch football.


this sounds kindof gay


	...Isn't it unusual for a member of Congress to have such close ties to a foreign government?

	Yes — the FBI reportedly warned Rohrabacher in 2012 that Russian intelligence services were trying to recruit him as an "agent of influence" to help steer U.S. policy in Moscow's favor, according to the New York Times.


Rohrabacher prances around Putin's agents as FBI furrorws their brows


	During the 2016 campaign, WikiLeaks released emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. American spy agencies say the group received those materials from Russia.

	In his meeting with Rohrabacher, Assange "emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure" of the emails, Rohrabacher's office said.

	Rohrabacher spokesman Ken Grubb said the congressman and Assange also talked about possibilities that would allow him to leave the embassy, as well as what Assange knows about the DNC leaks. Grubb said no proposal is currently on the table.


so what is Rohrabacher going to do the same thing as with Magnitsky act, lobby for Assange release, claim evidence that Putin didn't do it, that sort of thing?

so now they can use this to mess with peoples online registrations

	...Amazon buckets -- where data is stored -- are private by default. This means someone at ES&S misconfigured a security setting and exposed the data online.

also ID theft


	...Data breaches like this happen far more frequently than the public might realize.

	Vickery said when he devotes one day to looking for exposed servers, he finds dozens of data breaches. Some are not as big as schematics on energy companies or millions of partial social security numbers, but he said it's something companies need to be much more aware of.

	"It's really kind of an epidemic that people don't have any idea about," Vickery said. "System administrators leaving things open and exposed to the public internet is like a cancer on security."

http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/18/opinions/russia-special-counsel-room-to-roam-opinion-zeldin/index.html
	Taken all together, Mueller's investigative mandate is broad.

	Its scope seems clear and includes investigating:
	(1) Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election;
	(2) the nature of any links between the Russian government and any and all individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign;
	(3) the nature of any coordination between the Russian government and any and all individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign;
	(4) any matters that have arisen out of the Russian election interference investigation;
	(5) any matters that might arise directly from the Russian election interference investigation; and
	(6) any federal crimes committed in the course of or with the intent to interfere with the investigation.

	...It is unlikely that a signed agreement between the parties would exist. It is not probable that written documents expressly evidence a quid pro quo. It would be surprising if there were any Perry Mason-style confessions by witnesses appearing before the grand jury.

	To the extent that any evidence of a conspiracy were to exist and the conspiracy could be proven, it is likely that most of the evidence would be circumstantial -- that is, it may only consist of verbal understandings and tacit agreements through financial and other intermediaries and close business associates.

	Witness testimony, especially from individuals with knowledge of the core questions, will be critical. Financial relationships and dealings, even those remote in place and time, may be important to shed light on motive, intent or susceptibility to compromise. 


witnessess would be critical, doubtful "direct evidence" like a signed agreement, circumstancial evidence


	...As Mueller's investigation matures, it may come to pass that some of the leads investigated (including possibly Trump's and/or his family's financial dealings) will prove to have merit, but that they may be beyond the scope of Mueller's original mandate. If so, what Mueller and Rosenstein will have to consider is how best to resolve these issues. Section 600.4 provides a mechanism.

	It provides: "If in the course of his or her investigation the special counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specified in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the course of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the special counsel's jurisdiction or assign them elsewhere."

	As such, Rosenstein, acting in consultation with Mueller, must reach a decision as to whether and in what circumstances it would be in the best interests of justice to expand the original mandate to allow the special counsel to investigate and resolve fully these matters and/or to investigate any other new matters that may have come to light in the course of the investigation.

	...In an investigation such as this, with so many aspects, allegations, and participants spread across the globe, it is much too early to cut off any investigative leads

	The financial dealings of the Trump businesses and those of his family and business associates, whether directly related or not, may provide an understanding that is relevant to the heart of the investigation. If they do, they are, de facto, not unrelated.

	If the financial dealings prove to be unrelated, the regulations offer two possible solutions -- refer that aspect of the investigation to the Department of Justice to handle, or expand the mandate to cover the resolution of the matter. In either case, justice will be served.


Mueller might need to ask Rosenstein to expand scope?

http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/opinions/can-trump-fire-mueller-opinion-zeldin/index.html
	Most relevant to the question of whether the President can fire the special counsel is Section 600.7(d), which reads: "The Special Counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney General may remove a special counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies. The Attorney General shall inform the Special Counsel in writing of the specific reason for his or her removal." (Emphasis added.)

He, like most press reports note, thinks if President Trump were to come out tomorrow in favor of abortion rights, the Democrats would suddenly become the most pro-life party in America (gallows humor)1. If the President comes out for tax reform, he suspects it will not pass Congress. “He’s got no clout now,” says the congressman.

	You could hear the frustration in his voice. “He just can’t shut up…. And we go home and everybody blames us for what’s going on. I don’t think the people on TV understand that most people still hate us more than him, but he’s making it even harder. We may be the turd in the field, but he’s the worm in the turd.”

	Harley Rouda, a Democrat running against Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) in 2018, has asked the FBI to probe the Republican congressman’s “political and financial ties to Russia” after Rohrabacher met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

hmmm I wonder why

	And where does India stand in the great geopolitical battles of our times? Will it uphold a new “non-alignment” policy between the United States and China, or take sides? So far, New Delhi hasn’t helped the situation with its own indecision.

	“Not since the 1950s has Indian foreign policy encountered such a critical crossroads, and for now the country is sleepwalking its way forward, with no clear vision or strategy,” Leslie Keerthi Kumar SM, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi, wrote in the Diplomat last month.

	Last month, McCain cast the deciding "no" vote on the Senate floor against a bill to repeal key elements of the healthcare law known as Obamacare. With that vote, the bill was defeated, 51-49, dealing President Donald Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell a crushing political setback.

	McCain, the son and grandson of admirals, was a U.S. Navy pilot whose plane was shot down over Vietnam in 1967. He spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam and was tortured repeatedly.

	The revolution was a ploy to end the war in the East so that Germany could break the Western Front. It almost worked, too.


first time I ever heard that one...


https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6u9z1f/lenin_was_on_his_way_to_bolshevik_hq_to_force_the/dlrvf5o/
	He was on his way, yes, but you're missing vital context: Erich Ludendorff, commander of the German military in the second half of WW1, plucked Lenin from exile and sent Lenin to Russia as an attempt to destabilize Russia. Lenin was literally a philosophical and governmental weapon that was used in aim to try to keep the much larger (yet worse equipped) Russian army from interfering with Germany's European operations.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff
	After the war, Ludendorff became a prominent nationalist leader, and a promoter of the Stab-in-the-back myth, which posited that the German loss in World War I was caused by the betrayal of the German Army by Marxists, Bolsheviks, and Jews who were furthermore responsible for the disadvantageous settlement negotiated for Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.


...technically true? I mean I guess some of them were Jewish

	
   		By the Revolution the Germans have made themselves pariahs among the nations, incapable of winning allies, helots in the service of foreigners and foreign capital, and deprived of all self-respect. In twenty years' time, the German people will curse the parties who now boast of having made the Revolution.

    	Erich Ludendorff, My War Memories, 1914–1918

    The historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson notes that after the war, Ludendorff wanted Germany to go to war against all of Europe, and that he became a pagan worshiper of the Nordic god Wotan (Odin); he detested not only Judaism, but also Christianity, which he regarded as a weakening force.[64] By contrast, some believed that he had become a pacifist

huh


https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14608/did-the-germans-purposefully-arrange-to-send-lenin-to-russia-to-start-a-revoluti
	A recent documentary, The World Wars, on the History Channel suggested, strongly, that the Imperial German government secretly arranged safe-passage for Vladimir Lenin to return to Moscow from Switzerland in 1917. Moreover, the Germans gave him financing through 1918 with the hope that Lenin would start a revolution that would cause Russia to withdraw its war with Germany during World War I.

why is she doing this? why on front page of r/politics? why's she on CNN?


	Tolokonnikova: I don't believe that Putin's interference in the American election really brought Trump to power. I believe that there are other structural problems in American society and American economy that probably brought Trump to power, and Bernie Sanders talked a lot about these problems. I don't think that Putin is the first and the only reason that Trump was elected, but definitely he did interfere in American elections as he just interfered in elections in Montenegro, he's interfered in Ukraine's elections and he started a war in Ukraine. He has a long history of doing that. He has a long history of seeing what you call fake news and we call propaganda with things like Russia Today channel and with trolls and bots.


	...Tolokonnikova: When you talk about Russia and America, you don't need to think that Russia is Putin. Russia and Putin is two different things, and we have a lot of people in Russia who are not the same, (do not) think in a similar way as Vladimir Putin thinks.

	But Trump’s habits have consequences far beyond being the quirky, unchanging ways of a 70-year-old man who keeps an eye on cable as he goes about his day, as his confidants describe his behavior. Foreign diplomats have urged their governments’ leaders to appear on television when they’re stateside as a means of making their case to Trump, and U.S. lawmakers regard a TV appearance as nearly on par with an Oval Office meeting in terms of showcasing their standing or viewpoints to the president.

	Trump broke with longstanding precedent by telling Bloomberg he would consider a meeting with the North Korean president. The United States has no ties with North Korea and the country has repeatedly tried to fire missiles and build up a stockpile to harm the United States.

cyberwarfare hitting ship navigation systems?

	In a little noticed June 22 incident, someone manipulated GPS signals in the eastern part of the Black Sea, leaving some 20 ships with little situational awareness. Shipboard navigation equipment, which appeared to be working properly, reported the location of the vessels 20 miles inland, near an airport.

	That was the first known instance of GPS “spoofing,” or misdirection.

	Much more serious than jamming, spoofing interferes with location even as computer screens offer normal readouts. Everything looks normal – but it isn’t.

	“We saw it done in, I would say, a really unsubtle way, a really ham-fisted way. It was probably a signal that came from the Russian mainland,” Humphreys said.

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/how-america-lost-its-mind/534231/
	The idea that progress has some kind of unstoppable momentum, as if powered by a Newtonian law, was always a very American belief. However, it’s really an article of faith, the Christian fantasy about history’s happy ending reconfigured during and after the Enlightenment as a set of modern secular fantasies. It reflects our blithe conviction that America’s visions of freedom and democracy and justice and prosperity must prevail in the end. I really can imagine, for the first time in my life, that America has permanently tipped into irreversible decline, heading deeper into Fantasyland. I wonder whether it’s only America’s destiny, exceptional as ever, to unravel in this way. Or maybe we’re just early adopters, the canaries in the global mine, and Canada and Denmark and Japan and China and all the rest will eventually follow us down our tunnel. Why should modern civilization’s great principles—democracy, freedom, tolerance—guarantee great outcomes?

The revelation, which many in the White House expected to be bombshell news, was largely overshadowed by the revelation that same day of an “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald Trump made crude and sexist comments to anchor Billy Bush.

	The U.S. intelligence community on Friday accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election in its strongest terms yet, alleging Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to undermine faith in the electoral process and developed a "clear preference" for President-elect Donald Trump.

	Two months before Esteban Santiago allegedly unleashed a deadly assault inside the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the 26-year-old former National Guardsman showed up unannounced – and troubled – at the Anchorage, Alaska offices of the FBI.

	There, according to the FBI, Santiago told federal authorities that U.S. intelligence agencies had gained control of his mind and were urging him to fight for the Islamic State terror group. While the report was initially alarming, it was soon clear that the young man's reported complaint was more a cry for medical treatment than a matter meriting the attention of counter-terrorism officials.

	"During the interview, Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements,'' the FBI said in a statement Friday night. "Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Santiago and transported him to a local medical facility for evaluation.  The FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, inter-agency checks, and interviews of his family members.''

    Declassified Documents Reveal KGB Spies in the U.S. 
 
    ...newly released documents from U.S. and Soviet archives show that hundreds of people, from the famous to the obscure, crossed paths with Soviet intelligence during the pre-World War II years. They include the country's most famous physicist, Robert Oppenheimer, novelist Ernest Hemingway, and civil servants like Hiss. There were journalists, too, like Walter Lippmann, I. F. Stone, and Bernard Redmont, a former correspondent for U.S. News who has been denying spying allegations for more than a half century.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bentley
	Elizabeth Terrill Bentley (January 1, 1908 – December 3, 1963) was an American spy for the Soviet Union from 1938 until 1945. In 1945 she defected from the Communist Party and Soviet intelligence and later (1952) became an informer for the U.S. She exposed two networks of spies, ultimately naming over 80 Americans who had engaged in espionage for the Soviets.

https://books.google.com/books?id=qCAVQ_cdomcC&pg=PA57
	Redmont continued to hew the position that Bentley was a fantasits, linking her to "pathological liars, cranks, seekers of attention or publicity, or paid purveyors of tales and innuendoes." He insisted that he had been a victim of hysteria: "Tens of thousands of us, who in some way had the wrong acquantances, or had been denounced, anonymously or not, but informers, crackpots or self-styled patriots, were caught in the gears."

	The evidence is, however, that Bernard Redmont, distinguised American journalist and dean of a college of journalism, was the fabricator, not Elizabeth Bentley. An October 1994 KGB report lists his real nae and cover name ("Mon") and identifies him as one of Bentley's sources. A January 1945 report again lists him as a Bentley contact with his real name and "Mon" cover name and adds that he had a Communist Party name of "Berney," that he wrked in the press department of the CIAA, and that he had become and inactive source. In December 1945 the KGB station in London informed Moscow Center that Kim Philby had turned over a copy of Bentley's 1945 FBI statement given to British SIS.  The KGB report listed forty-one KGB sources Bentley had identified to the FBI, adding their KG cover names (which Bentley had not known). THe last one on the list was, "41. Bernard Redmont (Mon)." A 1948 report, again giving his real name and "Mon" cover name, listed him among the Soviet intelligence contacts expoed by Bentley's defection. He may have been a minor soruce, but documentary evidence is that he was a source.

	North korean spy caught on video stealing missile plans from Ukraine

	...In a rare window into the opaque, deadly and secretive world of missile technology espionage, Ukrainian security services have given CNN surveillance footage and details of an elaborate sting operation they carried out to snare two North Korean spies in 2011.

	The revelations are aimed at dispelling claims that a recent leap forward in Pyongyang's intercontinental missile technology may have been achieved by using designs stolen or originating from Ukraine.

	The claims are made in a report released by analysts at the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) on August 14 which says technology, possibly from Ukraine's Yuzhnoye Design Office in Dnipro, was used in recent North Korean missile tests.

	In July, North Korea successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) -- the KN-14 or Hwasong-14. At the time, Pyongyang claimed they were capable of carrying a "large-sized heavy nuclear warhead" as far as the US mainland.

	Ukraine has denied any link to North Korea's long-range missiles, and said Russia may instead have provided Pyongyang with the improved missile designs. Russia has denied supporting North Korea's arms program.

	...Denys Chernyshov, Ukraine's deputy minister for justice, said the men had been met once by two officials from North Korea's Moscow embassy, but otherwise had no contact at all with their relatives or North Korea.

	...Chernyshov added the pair were well-trained.

	"To be isolated in another country and culture, with different food even, that brings about a particular stress," he said. "So it is clear these are well prepared, strong people."

	However, he added North Korea may not turn out to be that welcoming when they likely travel home in September 2018, at the end of their sentences.

	"That their task was unsuccessful, they cannot expect much of a hero's welcome on their return."

	..Pompeo has not impeded that work, officials said. But several officials said there is concern about what he might do if the CIA uncovered new information potentially damaging to Trump and Pompeo were forced to choose between protecting the agency or the president.

	.“People have to watch him,” said a U.S. official who, like others, requested anonymity to speak frankly. “It’s almost as if he can’t resist the impulse to be political.”

	A second former CIA official cited a “real concern for interference and politicization,” saying that the worry among some at the agency is “that if you were passing on something too dicey [to Pompeo] he would go to the White House with it.”

	Trump has struggled in the past with matching his tone to the setting. In the wake of a massacre at an Orlando nightclub in 2016 that was inspired by ISIS, Trump tweeted “thanks for the congrats” in reference to his warnings about terrorism. And in a July speech that was supposed to be about celebrating the Boy Scouts of America, Trump diverged to campaign themes and winding anecdotes. That same week he appeared to encourage police officers to rough up suspects in an address to law enforcement — the White House later said he was joking.

	Even on Monday, he was unapologetic about timing the controversial announcement of his pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio to the storm’s arrival on Friday night.

	“Actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they were normally,” Trump said during the news conference.

	All of that presents a certain risk for Trump on Tuesday. Critics, though, have been quick to praise Trump when he sticks to a script, which he did at points during Monday’s remarks.

	“Tragic times such as these bring out the best in America’s character — strength, charity and resilience,” he declared at the news conference, reading from prepared remarks. “We see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend and stranger helping stranger. You see that all over.”

	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he hoped a government shutdown would not be necessary over his demand that the U.S. Congress fund his proposed wall along the southern border with Mexico.

	At a news conference with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, Trump also said Mexico may pay for the wall by reimbursement. Mexico has adamantly said it will not pay for the wall.

	“One way or the other Mexico is going to pay for the wall,” said Trump.

	Trump also said he would probably need to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement treaty to get what he considers a fair trade deal with U.S. economic partners Mexico and Canada.

	“I believe that you will at least have to start the termination process before a fair deal can be arrived at,” he said.

Trump gets his ideas from internet message boards

	Though Posobiec’s claims led to a shooting a Washington pizza store in December 2016, the president retweeted Posobiec earlier in August, after he defended the president’s controversial remarks about white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va.

	Trump’s “retweet of me was almost like an endorsement … in a very broad sense,” Posobiec said during an interview with the Globe at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where he requested to meet. “It was almost like he was validating what we, the alt-media, are doing.”

	...There are different ways information gets from the alt-media world to the president, according to interviews with alt-media members and independent experts. Sometimes, experts said, it happens because an outlet the president trusts — mainly Fox News — picks up on the “alt-media’s” claims. Other times, the alt-media contingent feeds information directly to Trump’s inner circle — through back channels or on social media.

	“One of the ways to influence the president is to make sure there’s things on Fox that interest him or make sure you can get something trending that he’ll see before he goes to bed,” said Johnson. “The paradigm that existed previously, that we’ll control the president by controlling his access to him and his reading list — that’s over in the Internet age.”


	...The White House did not respond to questions about its relationship with pro-Trump Internet outlets. In interviews during the campaign, Trump officials acknowledged they monitored online forums such as Reddit and other message boards to get ideas and feedback.


hello!

	...Reddit is a discussion website where members can post nearly anything in forums, largely under the cloak of anonymity. The website has consistently faced criticism for being a platform for false and objectionable content.

yes

	...“Riots. Crime. Chaos. Cover-ups” read a video shared by Cernovich and Posobiec with their 500,000 combined Twitter followers on Feb. 2.

	Fox News’ Tucker Carlson picked up the story two weeks later, the day before Trump made his statement.

	“We’ve got to keep our country safe,” Trump told his supporters at a campaign-style rally in Florida later that month. “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?”

	Trump’s ‘fire and fury’ policy on North Korea has ‘crashed and burned’: Former State Department official

	The latest missile firing by North Korea is a clear sign that the U.S. policy for dealing with Pyongyang isn't working, national security and foreign policy strategist Joel Rubin told CNBC on Tuesday.

	...He said the United States' allies do not have the confidence the U.S. has a real strategy to prevent North Korea from continuing to provoke nations and expand its nuclear and missile programs.

	"We really need to get into the diplomatic track more aggressively than we have been so far," he said in an interview with "Closing Bell."

	While the U.S. has said it prefers a diplomatic solution, Trump has previously left the door open for all options. Earlier this month, the president promised "fire and fury like the world has never seen" if North Korea continued to threaten the U.S. and its allies.

	Rubin said North Korea was testing the limits with its latest move.

	"This is North Korea doing what North Korea often does. However, what's different this time is that they have technical capacity that many analysts did not think they were going to achieve so quickly."

	He called the policy of the last 15 years "failed" and said there needs to be a broader diplomatic policy than just asking China to intervene.

	The recommendations were derailed amid an awkward, often unspoken power struggle between, on one end, federal agencies, which have more resources to combat cyber threats; and on the other, states and localities, which hold primary constitutional authority over elections.

	The states vigorously defend their territory, though they can be naive about cyber risks. Many have insisted their systems are secure.


why would they do that

	Both sides showed a “lack of seriousness” about voting security issues that spells trouble for protecting the nation’s jumble of election machinery against increasingly sophisticated threats, warned Neal McBurnett, a Boulder, Colorado, consultant who helped develop the guidelines.

	State and federal authorities aren’t moving fast enough “in coming up with ways to harden our targets and look at the problem with clear eyes," he said.


	...Absent witnesses or a confession, election officials could uncover vote rigging only if the affected jurisdiction required backup paper copies of electronic ballots so that post-election auditors could verify each candidate’s totals.

	EAC Chairman Matthew Masterson, who acknowledges that attempted cyberattacks on election systems are “persistent and sophisticated,” says about 25 percent of the votes cast in the 2016 election lacked paper backups.

	Petróleos de Venezuela SA offered Russia’s PAO Rosneft nearly half of the shares of its U.S.-based subsidiary Citgo Petroleum Corp. as collateral for $1.5 billion in loans the Russian firm made in 2016 to help prop up cash-starved PdVSA and its owner, the Venezuelan government.

	Feinstein expresses hope that Trump 'can be a good president'

	Sen. Dianne Feinstein surprised a San Francisco audience Tuesday with a hopeful message about President Donald Trump, telling the crowd that “I believe he can be a good president,” but only if he changes how he has operated thus far.

	“The question is whether he can learn and change,” Feinstein (D-Calif.) said, according to a San Francisco Chronicle report. “If so, I believe he can be a good president.”

	By Wednesday afternoon, the senator’s office had released a statement on her behalf, using much stronger language to criticize the president.

	“I’ve been strongly critical of President Trump when I disagree on policy and with his behavior,” Feinstein’s statement said, noting that she had been “appalled” by his comments in response to a deadly white supremacist rally in Virginia and by his pardon of controversial former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

	“To me, this is so far out of bounds it’s not even in the stadium,” says Chris Swecker, who retired from the FBI in 2006 as assistant director for the criminal investigative division and acting executive assistant director for law enforcement services. “If he had personally drafted it, put it in the corner of his desk and just looked at it himself from time to time,” that would be one thing, he says, but circulating the draft among executive staff seems to be “clearly communicating to them where the investigation was going to go.”

	Swecker, who had dealings with Comey and points out that he respects the former director, says he finds it odd that Comey drafted the statement before the June 2016 tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch, who was then attorney general, and Bill Clinton, since Comey has said he decided to issue his July 2016 statement because of that meeting.


	...Ron Hosko, who was an assistant FBI director under Comey until he retired in 2014, says drafting statements is common practice, as long as the drafts stay internal and avoid drawing conclusions. “When you have a significant case that is in the public domain and certainly in the public’s interest, in the public’s eye, I think that it could be expected that both the FBI, and the prosecutors that they’re working with, are beginning to draft a statement of facts that could be used later, as the case is developing,” he says. “I think the content of the statement is going to be important. Did it purport to essentially acquit her actions way prematurely, or was it simply a running statement of what they knew?”

	SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has backed presumptive U.S. Republican nominee Donald Trump, with a propaganda website praising him as “a prescient presidential candidate” who can liberate Americans living under daily fear of nuclear attack by the North.

	A column carried on Tuesday by DPRK Today, one of the reclusive and dynastic state’s mouthpieces, described Trump as a “wise politician” and the right choice for U.S. voters in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.

	Trump called Jong-Un a "maniac" during remarks about North Korea's nuclear program during a rally at Ottumwa, Iowa, but conceded, "You gotta give him credit."

	"How many young guys -- he was like 26 or 25 when his father died -- take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden ... he goes in, he takes over, and he’s the boss," Trump said. "It's incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn't play games."

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/business/media/cnn-retraction-trump-scaramucci.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur
	It was in that heated environment that the first major public lapse involving the team occurred.

	In early June, CNN published a bulletin saying that James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, would contradict Mr. Trump in testimony before Congress, disputing the president’s assertion that Mr. Comey had informed him three times that he was not under investigation.

	The article ran under the bylines of Mr. Lichtblau; the anchors Jake Tapper and Gloria Borger; and a producer, Brian Rokus. Ms. Borger relayed the news to viewers on-air.

	But the network soon began hearing from sources who said the information in the article was wrong. CNN was forced to issue a correction.

	...On June 22, a modest, 950-word story appeared on CNN’s website, reporting that a Trump adviser named Anthony Scaramucci — at the time not yet a household name — had ties to a Russian investment fund that had attracted the attention of investigators in the United States Senate.

	The story said that the Senate Intelligence Committee was examining the fund and that Mr. Scaramucci had met with the head of the fund, Kirill Dmitriev, several days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. It also said the Treasury Department had been looking into the meeting at the request of two Democratic senators, who had expressed concern that Mr. Scaramucci might have promised to help get sanctions against Russia waived by the new administration.

	The story was written by Thomas Frank, who had been a Pulitzer Prize finalist at USA Today. But Mr. Scaramucci, who was jockeying for a position in the White House, disputed the information when CNN contacted him for comment, according to a person close to Mr. Scaramucci; the story quoted Mr. Scaramucci as saying “there is nothing there,” in reference to his meeting with Mr. Dmitriev.

	Mr. Lichtblau was editing the article and, according to the people with direct knowledge of the events, he sent a draft of the story to Lex Haris, the head of the investigative unit. Mr. Haris, who was traveling to Phoenix for a conference, signed off — as long as the story passed muster with CNN’s internal review system, known as the Triad.

	The Triad includes CNN’s fact-checkers and its standards team, both of which approved the article. But the third prong, the legal department, had at least one question that went unanswered.

	It is not clear what specific concerns the legal department raised, or why Mr. Lichtblau and Mr. Haris did not address them; journalists at CNN said it was sometimes difficult to keep track of the flurry of inquiries that could come during the review process. (Mr. Frank, Mr. Haris and Mr. Lichtblau declined to comment for this story.)

	Mr. Lichtblau moved forward with publication. He emailed an editor affiliated with KFile, Kyle Blaine, who had not been involved in the story, and instructed him to publish it on his behalf.

	When the story was posted that afternoon, it received little attention — inside the newsroom and out. But Mr. Scaramucci and his representatives quickly contacted CNN officials, including the network’s Washington bureau chief, Sam Feist, to complain. It was an “all hands on deck’’ rebuttal, said the person familiar with Mr. Scaramucci’s response.

	Breitbart News, a frequent critic of CNN, soon posted an item that questioned CNN’s reporting, and called the network’s story “very fake news.’’ Citing its own source, Breitbart said there was no Senate investigation.

	When CNN managers began to review the piece, they discovered the legal department’s concerns — and that they had not been addressed. They also realized a factual error had slipped through the fact-checking process; it was a technicality related to a Russian bank’s relationship to the fund, but managers found it to have been a troubling lapse.

	And there was a more problematic issue, two people familiar with the review said.

	Mr. Frank’s single source had wavered before the story was published, expressing concern about how the information was being presented. But Mr. Frank had not relayed that hesitancy to his colleagues.

	Between Mr. Frank’s wavering source and the discovery of breakdowns in the editorial vetting process, executives concluded that the network could not stand behind the story. The day after the article was published, CNN removed it from its website and issued a formal retraction and an apology to Mr. Scaramucci.

	In a rare public appearance, the 85-year-old novelist and former spy spoke of his disdain for Trump and his despair for the US and the wider world.

	“Something truly, seriously bad is happening and from my point of view we have to be awake to that,” he told an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

	“These stages that Trump is going through in the United States and the stirring of racial hatred … a kind of burning of the books as he attacks, as he declares real news as fake news, the law becomes fake news, everything becomes fake news.

	“I think of all things that were happening across Europe in the 1930s, in Spain, in Japan, obviously in Germany. To me, these are absolutely comparable signs of the rise of fascism and it’s contagious, it’s infectious. Fascism is up and running in Poland and Hungary. There’s an encouragement about.”

	...The exclamation point on Wednesday’s events was the president’s appearance in North Dakota – an event ostensibly designed to pitch his tax plan, but which turned unexpectedly into a campaign rally of sorts for Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp. The president ushered the embattled senator, who is facing reelection in 2018, onstage during his speech. “Everybody’s saying, ‘What’s she doing up here?’” Trump said. “But I’ll tell you what: Good woman.”

	Heitkamp has also worked to ingratiate herself with Trump, calling Democratic resistance to the president “a waste of my time” and indicating she was eager to welcome Trump to North Dakota. An administration official said the president’s praise was merely a pressure tactic – an attempt to win Heitkamp’s support for the forthcoming tax-reform bill.

	While the potential Russian deal was still on the table, Trump was speaking positively about working with Russian President Vladimir Putin and also minimized Russia's aggressive military moves around the world. His willingness to accept narratives favored by the Kremlin contrasted with not only the Obama administration but also his Republican opponents.


Is this why he did that? he cares more about his stupid hotel deal than the country?

	We now know the motives. In backing Donald Trump, Russia’s oligarchical class sought not only to disrupt U.S. politics but also to reverse sanctions, both those applied in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and those connected to the Magnitsky Act, which targeted officials involved in human rights violations. 


but their spies call for more sanctions...


	..."I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away," Trump said in early January 2017 as President-elect. "We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict. I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals."

	...Investigators working for the special counsel are looking at whether Trump had any business dealings that could have put him or his associates in a compromising position with Russia.

	5 questions about the brain cancer diagnosed in Sen. John McCain 

	By Laurie McGinley, Lena H. Sun and Lenny Bernstein

	Glioblastoma, the cancer with which Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been diagnosed, is a highly lethal malignancy that killed Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Beau Biden, the son of former vice president Joseph Biden. Here is what you need to know


http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/10/04/how-ebola-sped-out-of-control/
	Story by Lena Sun, Brady Dennis, Lenny Bernstein, Joel Achenbach

	Tom Frieden remembers the young woman with the beautiful hair, dyed a rusty gold and braided meticulously, elaborately, perhaps by someone who loved her very much. She was lying facedown, half off the mattress. She had been dead for hours, and flies had found the bare flesh of her legs.

	Two other bodies lay nearby. Bedridden patients who had not yet succumbed said of the dead, "Please, get them out of here."

	Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), knew it was no simple matter to properly carry away a body loaded with Ebola virus. It takes four people wearing protective suits, one at each corner of the body bag. On that grim day near the end of August, in a makeshift Ebola ward in Monrovia, Liberia, burial teams already had lugged 60 victims to a truck for the trip to the crematorium.

	ABOVE: A sick child, Cynthia, waits outside Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, for health workers to remove dead bodies before she can enter.

	Frieden had seen plenty of death over the years, but this was far worse than he expected, a plague on a medieval scale. "A scene out of Dante," he called it.

	Fake news and creeping surrealism

	By Joel Achenbach

	...You were warned about this. Consider this passage:

    	The technology of falsehood has outraced our judgment. Alienated from nature, liberated from such barbaric responsibilities as the growing of food, the making of shelter, we have entered a mysterious phase in which we passively accept a cartoon version of reality that is projected upon us by unreliable, deceptive, and sometimes diabolical media.

	I wrote that in 1988. That’s not a typo. (It’s hard to find a good link to it because it was pre-Internet. That paragraph ran in Mother Jones, in a piece based on an earlier essay titled “Creeping Surrealism” that ran in the Miami Herald’s Tropic Magazine.) The bad guys in that piece were corporations, advertisers, TV stars, Hollywood — the professional manipulators of image. My essay also derided the public for not seeming to care about what was fake and what was real.

	 How Trump could really disrupt NASA and the space program

	 By Joel Achenbach

	 ...In these waning days of the Obama administration, NASA continues to brand its programs as part of a “Journey to Mars.” The label is, to some degree, public relations pure and simple.

	 ...The Trump folks could conceivably take the radical step of killing the SLS rocket -- the Space Launch System, a descendant of the heavy-lift rocket pushed a decade ago by the George W. Bush administration under its Constellation program. Obama officially killed Constellation, but elements survived, protected by several powerful senators. Those include the SLS and Orion, a crew capsule now in its second decade of development, with a price tag north of $10 billion. The idea is, the SLS will launch Orion into outer space, and Orion will orbit the moon, and the astronauts will return to Earth, and then they'll do that a bunch more times.

	It’s hard to kill big space programs that cost a lot of money. Think: stakeholders. Think: too big to fail.

	With Trump, Gingrich and GOP calling the shots, NASA may go back to the moon 

	By Joel Achenbach

	...“It is very plausible to speculate that the new administration will insert a mission to the lunar surface, probably international in character, as a step on the way to Mars,” John Logsdon, the dean of space policy analysts, told The Washington Post. “Politically, most of the other countries of the world have identified the moon as an interesting destination, and they don’t really have the capabilities to talk about sending people to Mars. If we want to assert international leadership, we would take a position in leading a coalition to return to the moon.” 

	...One of the people mentioned in news reports as a potential NASA administrator is Rep. James Bridenstine, Republican from Oklahoma, who earlier this year drafted legislation he calls the American Space Renaissance Act. He's called for a return to the moon as part of sweeping reforms at NASA. Bridenstine has also been mentioned as a potential secretary of the Air Force. In a written statement released by his press office, Bridenstine said: “At this point, it is speculation as far as I know.”


	...Bridenstine would be an outsider, but many Republicans might prefer Scott Pace, a former NASA political appointee under President George W. Bush. Pace succeeded Logsdon as director of George Washington University Space Policy Institute. In a radio interview on the Diane Rehm Show a while back, Pace advocated a return to the moon:

    	[T]he reason for that is not simply because I have a fondness for lunar science but because I think it could meet an important international objective, which is bringing other countries along with us, particularly emerging space powers, such as India and — I'll also say it — China, that NASA can and should be a foreign policy tool of the United States. And I think a human return to the moon poses some opportunities for international outreach in ways that asteroid or Mars missions right now cannot.

    ...NASA now says it is on a “Journey to Mars,” though this is more of a branding exercise for a suite of loosely connected enterprises than a fully integrated and funded program. The agency is building a new, heavy-lift rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), and a new crew capsule, Orion, both of which could be part of a Mars-mission architecture.

	 Mars is not a Plan B

	By Joel Achenbach September 28, 2016

	Over at Speaking of Science I have posted a few thoughts on Elon Musk and his plan to colonize Mars. Shorter version: Putting even one person on Mars, never mind a million people, is going to be very hard. There is no single technological show-stopper. But the risks are cumulative, the costs are incalculable, things go wrong, and any timeline that imagines humans on Mars in the next decade is magical thinking. Ask Loren Grush at The Verge: She runs through the whole list of challenges.

	...Among would-be star trekkers and planet-colonizers (Elon Musk et al) there’s often an implicit message that our goal as human beings ought to be survival on another world after our own is ruined. In “Interstellar” we see an O’Neill space colony where kids can play baseball but where, I’m guessing, the elephants didn’t make the cut, nor the whales, nor most of the other species from Earth. Really? That’s the best we can do? That’s the happy ending? If Earth dies and humans wind up somewhere else that’s not a W in my book, it’s a big L.

	Russia "probably did hack the systems" of the Democratic Party," but proof has never been proffered because there were likely a half dozen other attackers, too, Edward Snowden said in an extensive interview with Der Spiegel.

	And the revelation of there being a host of attackers on the Democratic National Committee would pour cold water on the Russia narrative, Snowden said in a Q&A.

	The Russians "probably did hack the systems of Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party, but we should have proof of that. In the case of the hacking attack on Sony, the FBI presented evidence that North Korea was behind it. In this case they didn't, although I am convinced that they do have evidence," Snowden told Der Spiegel.

	"I think the NSA almost certainly saw who the intruders were . . . but I am also convinced that they saw a lot of other attackers on there, too. There were probably six or seven groups. The Democratic National Committee . . . refused to provide these servers to the FBI, which is really weird. So, I think the reality here was it was narrative-shaping about the Russians," Snowden said.

	Importantly, since the International Space Station (ISS) is in low-Earth orbit within the magnetosphere, it also provides a large measure of protection for our astronauts.

	“We have instruments that measure the radiation environment inside the ISS, where the crew are, and even outside the station,” said Kerry Lee, a scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.

	This ISS crew monitoring also includes tracking of the short-term and lifetime radiation doses for each astronaut to assess the risk for radiation-related diseases. Although NASA has conservative radiation limits greater than allowed radiation workers on Earth, the astronauts are able to stay well under NASA’s limit while living and working on the ISS, within Earth’s magnetosphere.

	Schiaparelli touchdown would be ESA's first success on the red planet.

https://qz.com/816073/russias-space-program-is-great-at-launching-people-on-rockets-and-not-much-else/
	October 22, 2016

	This week the ExoMars team placed a satellite in orbit around the red planet but failed to land the accompanying spacecraft. Scientifically the mission was largely a success: the satellite will soon start sniffing the Martian atmosphere for signs of present or past life. But the lander’s failure is symbolic of the fortunes of Russia’s Roscosmos, which is an equal partner with the European Space Agency (ESA) on ExoMars.


why did it fail?


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/science/mars-crash-landing-site-explosion.html


says it crashed

other source says "lost contact" a minute before reaching surface


https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/1028/Schiaparelli-s-crash-What-happened-to-the-Mars-lander
	To Mark McCaughrean, a senior science adviser at ESA, that suggests that Schiaparelli was confused when it landed, having assumed too soon that it was on the ground.

	“Fundamentally there’s a software issue here between the radar and the on-board computer system,” he told the Associated Press. “The radar was giving inconsistent info on where it was.”

	That may help explain other evidence spotted by NASA’s cameras. Half a mile south of the probe's crater, a white feature was observed. The object has now been identified as the parachute meant to slow Schiaparelli down after entering the atmosphere of Mars. It was still attached to the rear heat shield, and both were apparently ejected from the lander earlier in the descent than they should have been.


and also lost contact? so no telemetry?


https://science.slashdot.org/story/16/10/29/013235/bad-code-may-have-crashed-schiaparelli-mars-lander
	cadogan west writes "In the accordance with the longstanding tradition of bad software wrecking space probes (See Mariner 1), it appears a coding bug crashed the ESA's latest attempt to land on Mars." Nature reports:



https://www.cbsnews.com/news/esa-mars-lander-schiaparelli-failed-soft-landing-data-sent-back/
	The European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli Mars lander plunged into the planet’s atmosphere Wednesday, survived the hellish heat of entry and successfully deployed a huge parachute to slow down before falling free and firing up its braking rockets to land on the martian surface, engineers said Thursday. 

	But then suddenly, its signal vanished.

	Fifty seconds before the expected touchdown, the experimental lander abruptly stopped transmitting telemetry. At that point, it was expected to be less than a mile above the surface and descending at about 150 mph.

	It’s not clear from a preliminary analysis of the data whether the lander could still be intact. 


these things need a black-box

	...But the telemetry suddenly stopped right around the moment the parachute was released. The recorded data show at least some of the thrusters fired for a few seconds at least, but engineers have not yet had time to tease out altitude, velocity and other details that might shed light on what happened in the 50 or so seconds between the loss of signal and the lander’s impact on the surface.

	“The parachute phase, I would say, has been nominal up to the very last point when the parachute is ejected,” Accomazzo said. “It’s there that we are not in a position yet to provide a description of exactly what has happened that doesn’t correspond to our simulations.”

	"Why is it that we’re hearing about this now because one of the guys gave a talk in Moscow a year ago?” Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute asked in an interview with the Guardian. The institute is now checking for signs of the signal, as is the research group Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI), but so far things have been quiet. And Shostak is skeptical. “Maccone’s explanation is that the Russians are ‘shy'. [But] it’s generally accepted procedure in the SETI community if you find a signal that you think is interesting, you call up people in another observatory and say: ‘Hey, here’s the position in the sky,’ and you see what happens," he said.

	Update: This mysterious space signal is definitely not from aliens
	By Sarah Kaplan

	The impulse to attribute any odd astronomical phenomena to extraterrestrial intelligence is so compelling it's practically its own law of physics. But jumping to “aliens” at the slightest mention of a strange signal kind of misses the point, Méndez said. Not everything has to come from aliens to be important.



https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-latest-debate-about-space-aliens-should-we-say-hello-or-keep-quiet/2015/02/28/43aa4a52-bcf5-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html
	“We have already sent signals into space that will alert the aliens to our presence with the transmissions and street lighting of the last 70 years,” Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in California and a supporter of the more aggressive approach, has written. “These emissions cannot be recalled.”

	That’s true only to a point, say the critics of active SETI. They argue that unintentional planetary leakage, such as “I Love Lucy,” is omnidirectional and faint, and much harder to detect than an intentional, narrowly focused signal transmitted at a known planet.


ya why the fuck would you do that

	...The odds that anyone will get that message are vanishingly small, but Drake did catch grief from Britain’s Astronomer Royal at the time, Sir Martin Ryle, who thought it was reckless. Drake shrugs and says, “Anyone who’s even 100 years ahead of us [in technology] could detect our run-of-the-mill transmission.”

	Drake said he doesn’t worry, as some do, that we would become depressed by contact with a superior civilization. Children aren’t depressed by the company of adults, he says. He compared SETI to doing research on ancient civilizations on Earth, such as the Greeks and the Romans.

	“We’re going to do the archaeology of the future,” Drake says. “We’re going to find out what we’re going to become.”

	In reality, it isn't logical to think that aliens would want to do either of those things, Shostak said. Space travel is expensive and requires an enormous investment, he said.

	"Anything that we have here, they could find where they live," Shostak said. If there was a resource found on Earth that did not exist on the aliens' home planet, there would certainly be easier ways to get or make the resource than coming here.

	ver 45,000 people have been evacuated from more than 200 facilities in 29 Russian cities after a wave of anonymous bomb threat calls over the past three days, amid speculation of either foreign interference or a domestic anti-terror drill. 

	On Wednesday, 15,000 people were evacuated from various facilities across Moscow, after bomb threat calls were made to twelve shopping centres, three railway stations and at least four universities. 

	Anonymous callers are reported to be making calls over the internet to emergency services, and usually naming several facilities with supposed explosive devices inside.

	...State-run RIA Novosti news agency cited another anonymous source that claimed bomb threat calls are “coming from Ukraine.”

	But several regional news outlets quoted unidentified military officials who maintain that the evacuations are part of a Russian anti-terror exercise, performed in preparation for the 2018 World Cup.

	...The unclassified talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who say that officials knew the attack was a planned terror operation while they were telling the public it was an act of violence that grew out of a demonstration over an anti-Islam video.

Sword and sheild:

AMONG DEPARTMENT V’S most ambitious proposals
for special actions during 1968 was an operation to
distract Western opinion from the suppression of the
Prague Spring by sabotaging a major oil pipeline,
codenamed ZVENO (“Link”), near the Austrian end of
Bodensee Lake, which was believed by the Centre to
carry 10 million tons of oil a year between Italy and West
Germany. By breaching the pipeline at the point where it
crossed the Rhine canal, Department V calculated that it
could pollute the Bodensee, and thus contaminate the
main source of drinking water on the West German—
Austrian frontier. To carry the explosive, the Vienna
residency purchased four Western-manufactured 1-liter
thermos flasks, as well as ten ballpoint pens—presumably
to conceal the detonators. The scapegoats for the
environmental disaster caused by the explosion were to be
Italian extremists allegedly retaliating for acts of sabotage
carried out by South Tyrol terrorists.
ZVENO set the pattern for most Department V
peacetime special actions: immensely laborious and
detailed preparations, followed by a reluctant decision not
to go ahead because of the political risks involved—in
particular, the possibility that, despite all the precautions
taken, the hand of the KGB might somehow be
discovered. The operation was postponed several times,
kept under review for a number of years and finally
abandoned.

WITH THE INTENSIFICATION of the Cold War in the
early years of the Reagan presidency and fears in the
Centre that the new president was planning a nuclear first
strike, Andropov became increasingly willing, both as
KGB chairman and as Brezhnev’s successor from 1982 to
1984, to use, or connive in the use of, terrorism against
United States and NATO targets. With Andropov’s
knowledge (and doubtless his blessing), East Germany
became what its last, non-Communist, interior minister,
Peter-Michael Diestel, later called “an Eldorado for
terrorists.” Among East Germany’s favorite terrorist
groups was the West German Red Army Faction (RAF).
Contemptuous of working-class reluctance to make a
revolution and inspired by slogans such as “Don’t argue
—destroy!,” the well-educated members of the RAF saw
themselves as the militant vanguard of the deplorably
inert proletariat, committed to the destruction of the
“bourgeois power structures” of both the FRG and
NATO. After a series of successful terrorist attacks in the
mid-1970s, however, a grand offensive planned by the
RAF in 1977 failed, and four of its leaders committed
suicide in prison.
Thanks to the sanctuary offered by East Germany to its
main surviving activists from 1977 onwards, the RAF was
able to regroup. With training, weapons, funds and false
identity documents provided by the Stasi, the Red Army
Faction launched a new offensive during the early 1980s.
In August 1981 a car bomb attack on the European
headquarters of the US airforce at Ramstein in West
Germany injured seventeen people; a month later RAF
terrorists made an unsuccessful rocket attack in
Heidelberg on the car of General Frederick Kroesen.
During another terrorist offensive in 1984-5, the RAF
attempted to blow up the NATO school at
Oberammergau, bombed the US airbase at
Frankfurt/Main, and attacked American soldiers at
Wiesbaden. The Stasi also connived in the bombing of the
La Belle discothèque in West Berlin, helping to transport
the explosives which killed an American sergeant and a
Turkish woman and wounded 230 people, including fifty
US servicemen. Other Stasi contacts included the
Provisional IRA, the Basque ETA and Carlos the
Jackal. 96
In 1983, at the height of operation RYAN (the
combined KGB/GRU attempt to find (nonexistent)
evidence of US and NATO plans for a surprise nuclear
attack), Andropov ordered preparations by Department 8
for terrorist attacks on British, American and NATO
targets in Europe. Plans were made for a campaign of
letter bombs to be sent to Mrs. Thatcher’s office at 10
Downing Street and to a series of prominent US and
NATO representatives. 97 At about the same time the KGB
organized a series of dead drops in bars and restaurants
near American bases in West Germany, intended to
conceal explosives which could be detonated in a manner
that would give the impression of terrorist attacks. The
dead drop sites included behind a vending machine, in a
ventilation cavity under a sink, on a wooden beam over a
lavatory and underneath a paper-towel dispenser. By the
time the sites were discovered by the CIA in 1985,
however, operation RYAN was winding down and plans
for a KGB terrorist campaign against NATO targets had
been shelved. 98
In August 1983, while RYAN was still in full swing,
the Centre instructed the main residencies in European
NATO countries to step up their search for NATO
preparations for
the secret infiltration of sabotage teams with nuclear,
bacteriological and chemical weapons into the
countries of the Warsaw Pact; [and] the expansion of
the network of sabotage-training intelligence schools
and increase in the recruitment of émigrés from the
socialist countries and persons who know the
language of these countries, and the creation of
émigré military formations and sabotage and
intelligence teams. 99
Though, as with most of the requirements for operation
RYAN, there was no such intelligence to collect, the
Centre’s instructions give an important insight into
Moscow’s contingency plans for the role of Department 8
and its DRGs in an attack on NATO.

One of the messages intercepted in the Berlin tunnel
revealed the existence of a Soviet agent working for
British intelligence in Berlin, but it was not until 1961
that evidence from the Polish SB defector Michał
Goleniewski identified the agent as Blake. 14 Blake was
sentenced to forty-two years in jail but served only five
before escaping from Wormwood Scrubs with the help of
three former inmates who had befriended him, the Irish
bomber Sean Bourke and the peace protesters Michael
Randle and Pat Pottle. On October 22, 1966 Blake
knocked a loosened iron bar out of his cell window, slid
down the roof outside and dropped to the ground, then
climbed over the outer wall with a nylon rope ladder
thrown to him by Bourke. Hidden in the Randle family
dormobile, Blake was driven to East Berlin, where a
fortnight later he was joined by Bourke. Once in Moscow,
Blake and Bourke rapidly fell out. Blake writes in his
memoirs that, “Arrangements were made for [Bourke] to
return to Ireland.” 15 He does not mention, and may not
have known, that on the instructions of Sakharovsky, the
head of the FCD, Bourke was given before his departure a
drug designed to cause brain damage and thus limit his
potential usefulness if he fell into the hands of British
intelligence. Bourke’s premature death in his early forties
probably owed as much to KGB drugs as to his own
heavy drinking.


...


The Soviet intelligence offensive against West Germany
during the Cold War had three distinguishing
characteristics. First, the division of Germany made the
Federal Republic (FRG) easier to penetrate than any other
major Western state. So many refugees fled to the West
from the misnamed German Democratic Republic (GDR)
—about three million before the building of the Berlin

why is Wines reporting this?


	...Russian officials granted them access to some documents for their latest work, which primarily traces the fabulous course of the Doctors' Plot, a supposed collusion in the late 1940's by Kremlin doctors to kill top Communist leaders.

	The collusion was in fact a fabrication by Kremlin officials, acting largely on Stalin's orders. By the time Stalin disclosed the plot to a stunned Soviet populace in January 1953, he had spun it into a vast conspiracy, led by Jews under the United States' secret direction, to kill him and destroy the Soviet Union itself.

	That February, the Kremlin ordered the construction of four giant prison camps in Kazakhstan, Siberia and the Arctic north, apparently in preparation for a second great terror -- this time directed at the millions of Soviet citizens of Jewish descent.

	But the terror never unfolded. On March 1, 1953, two weeks after the camps were ordered built and two weeks before the accused doctors were to go on trial, Stalin collapsed at Blizhnaya, a north Moscow dacha, after the all-night dinner with his four Politburo comrades.

	After four days, Stalin died, at age 73. Death was laid to a hemorrhage on the left side of his brain.

	Less than a month later, the doctors previously accused of trying to kill him were abruptly exonerated and the case against them was deemed an invention of the secret police. No Jews were deported east. By year's end, Beria faced a firing squad, and Khrushchev had tempered Soviet hostility toward the United States.


Wines believes in the Doctor's plot?


	...The authors say that Stalin knew of his comrades' fears, citing as proof remarks at a December 1952 meeting of top Communist leaders in which Stalin began laying out the scope of the Doctors' Plot and the American threat to Soviet power.

	''Here, look at you -- blind men, kittens,'' the minutes record Stalin as saying. ''You don't see the enemy. What will you do without me?''

Sword and Shield:

Though Hall tended to overstate the influence of
undeclared members of the CPUSA within the
Democratic Party, there was at least one to whom the
Centre attached real importance during the 1970s: a
Democratic activist in California recruited as a KGB
agent during a visit to Russia. The agent, who is not
identified by name in the reports noted by Mitrokhin, had
a wide circle of influential contacts in the Democratic
Party: among them Governor Jerry Brown of California,
Senator Alan Cranston, Senator Eugene McCarthy,
Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Abraham Ribicoff,
Senator J. William Fulbright and Congressman John
Conyers, Jr. During the 1976 presidential election the
agent was able to provide inside information from within
the Carter camp and a profile of Carter himself, which
were particularly highly valued by the Centre since it had
so few high-level American sources. On one occasion he
spent three hours discussing the progress of the campaign
at a meeting with Carter, Brown and Cranston in Carter’s
room at the Pacific Hotel. His report was forwarded to the
Politburo. During the final stages of the campaign the
agent had what the KGB claimed were “direct and
prolonged conversations” with Carter, Governor Brown
and Senators Cranston, Kennedy, Ribicoff and Jacob
Javits. Andropov attached such importance to the report
on these conversations that he forwarded it under his
signature to the Politburo immediately after Carter’s
election

who's this?




	...Among the most important was the French radical politician Pierre Cot, six times Minister of Air and twice Minister of Commerce in the short-lived governments of the prewar Third Republic.

	...Zarubin approached Cot and, with his habitual brusqueness, pressed Cot to begin active work as a Soviet agent forthwith. Cot’s KGB file records that he was taken aback by the peremptory nature of Zarubin’s summons and insisted that one of the leaders of the French Communist Party exiled in Moscow give his approval.

	...Most other pre-war agents, however, were successfully reactivated, among them Laurence Duggan (FRANK) and Harry Dexter White (JURIST). Henry Wallace, vice-president during Roosevelt’s third term of office (1941 to 1945), said later that if the ailing Roosevelt had died during that period and he had become president, it had been his intention to make Duggan his Secretary of State and White his Secretary of the Treasury. The fact that Roosevelt survived three months into an unprecedented fourth term in the White House, and replaced Wallace with Harry Truman as vice- president in January 1945, deprived Soviet intelligence of what would have been its most spectacular success in penetrating a major Western government. The NKVD succeeded none the less in penetrating all the most sensitive sections of the Roosevelt administration.

Bolshevik Okhrana assassin assassinated prime minister of Russian in 1911








https://books.google.com/books?id=V3IeAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA418&lpg=PA418
	New Lights on the Russian Revolution

	June 14, 1919

	...He does not pay much attention to the stories of atrocities and German bribery, tho he does not question that both have occurred. Bolshevism, he says, is merely an inverted form of Czarism and he quotes Lenin to prove it:

		Just as one hundred and fifty thousand lordly landowners under Czarism dominated the one hundred and thirty millions of Russian peasants, so two hundred thousands members of the Bolshevik party are imposing their proletarian will on the mass, but this time in the interest of the latter.

	It is a strange anomaly that a system based exclusively upon an industrial proletariat should have found its greatest success in a country which contains only 5 per cent of that class and in which the peasantry, excluded by Lenin's definition from the working class, constitute 85 per cent.

	Mr. Spargo traces the intricate history of the Russian revolutionary parties and shows how the Socialists in 1902 slit in two, the majojrity (Bolsheveki) following Lenin, and the minority (Mensheviki) following Plechanov. At first the Bolsheviki were nurst by the Czar, later by the Kaiser. The most violent of the Bolshevik leaders in the Duma, Malinovsky, a close friend of Lenin, turned out to be a police spy and *provocateur*, and his fiery speeches attacking the Government and the bourgeoisie were written for him by Beletzky of the Police Department.

	...Bolshevism, as the word is commonly used, has been defined by some wit as "any sort of social movement that scares you most to death." But while this sense may serve the purpose of ordinary vituperation it is necessary to get a closer understanding of Bolshevism if it is to be combated and counteracted. Here Mr. Spargo's clear-cut analysis is useful:

		Instead of being fanatical idealists, incapable of compromizes and adjustments, the Bolsheviki have, from the very beginning, been loudly scornful of rigid and unbending idealism; have made numerous compromizes, alliances, and "political deals," ad have repeatedly shifted their ground in accordance with political expediency. they have been consistently local to no aim save one--the control of power. They have been opportunists of the most extreme type. There is not a single Socialist or democratic principle which they have not abandoned when it served their political ends; not a single instrument, principle or device of autocratic despotism which they have not used when by so doing they could gain power.

		They are not self-seeking adventurers, as many would have us believe. They are sincerely and profoundly convinst that the goal of social and economic freedom and justice can be more easily attaind by their method than by the method of democratic Socialism. Sill, the fact remains that what social ideas they hold are no part of Bolshevism They are Socialist ideals. Bolshevism is a distinctive method and a program, and its essence is the relentless use of power by the proletariat against the rest of society in the same manner that the bourgeois and military rules of nations have commonly used it against the proletariat Bolshevism has simply inverted the old Czarist regime.

	...Ambassador Francis told her that he had offered American troops to Kerensky but the offer was declined as unnecessary. It has been ah rd to understand the actions of the Russian GOvernment previous to the revolution, but it is all explained when we hear that this policy was dictated to Minister Protopopov by the ghost of the murdered Rasputin. Princes Cantacuzene confirms that rumor that the revolution retarded the withdrawal of Russia from the war, for Premir Sturmer was about to make peace with Germany when he was overthrown.

	...The charge that the Bolshevik movement was secretly encouraged by the Russian Government before the war is confirmed by Serge Persky in the latest volume of his journalistic articles, From Nicholas II to Lenin. He has a photograph of notes of a speech delivered by Malinovsky in the Duma which had been OK'd and annotated by the Minister Maarof. Pravda ("Truth"), the official organ of the Bolshevists, was subsidzed by the Okhrana (secret politce), and Lenin himself in 1910 or 1911 had relations with them. When this was exposed Lenin defended himself in the same fashion as when charged with receiving German aid:

		It was not eh Okhrana that made use of us but on the contrary we that made use of the Okhrana. Without doubt the Okhrana has rendered great services to our party without ever obtaining anything from us.

	Altho all these authors are strongly opposed to the Bolsheviki and we have nothing on the other side, still their standpoints are so diverse otherwise that we may get from them a tolerably correct view of the early stages of the revolution.

another Okhrana bolshevik



http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/01/entertainment/la-ca-alex-butterworth-20100801
    Rachkovsky followed his prey abroad; as head of the Paris branch of the Okhrana, he planted agents among the émigrés who goaded angry, naïve young people into what the author describes as "heinous crimes of which they might never have otherwise conceived." Butterworth credibly documents instances across Europe in which a mysterious figure appeared in anarchist circles, armed with cash and access to explosives, provoked them to target public places for maximum damage, then vanished just as the police swooped in — sometimes before the bombs went off, sometimes not.


http://www.historylink.org/File/11106
 The end of World War I in November 1918 did not bring the peace that so many hoped for. As 1919 dawned, revolutions were ongoing in Europe and insurrections were igniting elsewhere, while in the United States tensions between management and labor were boiling. In numerous American cities that year strikes large and small broke out, some of which became violent and ended with fatalities. At the same time, communist-leaning anarchists, many of whom were believed to be associated with the radical labor union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) wreaked havoc by planting and mailing dozens of bombs throughout the country. Fear of communism, often called Bolshevism in 1919, brought on a "Red Scare" that was every bit as intense in 1919 America as it was during the more well-known McCarthy era of the early 1950s.

It was against this increasingly paranoid backdrop that America's first general strike took place in February 1919 in Seattle. It fizzled out after five days, and a new hero arose: Mayor Ole Hanson, a former realtor who had been elected mayor the preceding March. During the strike he threatened to impose martial law (he actually didn't have the authority), issued a proclamation declaring that "the anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs" ("Proclamation"), and called more than a thousand army troops from Camp Lewis (later named Fort Lewis) into the city. Though the strike likely would have failed without his intervention, many nonetheless saw his aggressive posturing as stopping a Bolshevik revolution in its tracks. Near-universal praise from across the country swept into Seattle, but the attention also apparently made Hanson the target of a determined group of radicals.

Upside Down

On April 28, 1919, Hanson was in Colorado on a Victory Liberty Loan speaking tour, part of the country's final effort to sell bonds to cover the costs of World War I. That morning, an innocuous-looking package bearing the return address of Gimbel Brothers, a department store in New York City, arrived in the mayor's office. Hanson's regular secretary, G. A. Conklin, was with the mayor, and M. H. Strouse, chief clerk in the city's building department, had been drafted as the mayor's acting secretary. Strouse opened the package's wrapper and found a small box; opening that, he found a roughly six-inch-long, inch-and-a-half-diameter wooden tube with a cap on the end. He casually attempted to open the cap, but it stuck. Holding the tube cap-end down, he gave it a firmer tug and the cap broke. Liquid (some type of acid, though accounts of what type differ) streamed out and stung his hand. The startled Strouse saw several percussion caps and a small glass vial inside the tube and realized it might be a bomb, though at first he also thought it might be a joke.

Strouse was fortunate. He opened the wooden tube upside down, and the bomb failed to explode. It turned out that the wooden container was designed so the glass vial could not be removed without breaking it. Had Strouse been holding the tube right-side up when the vial broke, the acid would have flowed down the tube onto three percussion caps, exploding the caps and the powdered dynamite packed below.

The police were called. Word quickly spread and rumors flew even faster. The Seattle Times reported that the police had been notified of a sinister-sounding conversation overheard on a streetcar that the mayor would soon be "got" ("Chemists ..."). But the streetcar gossip only got part of the story. The plot wasn't against just Seattle's mayor. It was nationwide.

36 Bombs

The next day a bomb arrived at the Georgia home of former U.S. Senator Thomas Hardwick (1872-1944). The senator was out, but his wife and the family maid were home. Maude Hardwick opened the package but couldn't open the wooden tube inside it. She asked the maid to open the tube. The maid used a knife to force its top off, and when she did, the bomb exploded. The maid lost both of her hands and Mrs. Hardwick was also injured, though not as seriously.

Late that night an alert postal employee in New York City, Charles Caplan, read a newspaper account about the Hardwick bomb and the details of the package it was sent in. He realized he had 16 similar packages being held for insufficient postage in the parcel-postage storage room at the 30th Street and 8th Avenue post office. Warnings went out to every post office in the United States and Canada. More packages were found and some were intercepted. A few arrived at their destinations, but by this time the recipients knew better than to open them.

At least 36 bombs were eventually discovered, believed by authorities to have been the work of anarchists associated with the IWW as part of a strategy to wage "class war." The targets included U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841-1935), U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer (1872-1936), John D. Rockefeller Sr. (1839-1937), and J. P. Morgan Jr. (1867-1943).

Sword and Shield:


Stalin continued to doctor his own pre-Revolutionary
record during the 1920s, changing even the day and year
of his birth; the correct date (December 6, 1878) was not
made public until 1996. 24 During a visit to the secret
section of the Moscow Main Archives Directorate
(Glavarkhiv), Mitrokhin was once shown an Okhrana file
on Dzhugashvili. The file cover and title followed
standard Okhrana format, but, on looking inside,
Mitrokhin discovered that the contents had been entirely
removed. The probability is that the Okhrana had
compromising materials on the young Dzhugashvili, and
that at the first opportunity Stalin arranged for the file to
be gutted. In typical Soviet bureaucratic fashion, however,
the cover was preserved since the existence of the file was
indelibly recorded in the secret registers. Mitrokhin
suspects that whoever emptied the file, presumably on
Stalin’s instructions, was later eliminated to preserve the
dark secret of its missing contents. 25 What Stalin was
most anxious to destroy may well have been evidence that
he had been an Okhrana informer. Though it falls well
short of conclusive proof, a possible trace of that evidence
still survives. According to reports from an Okhrana agent
discovered in the State Archive of the Russian Federation,
Baku Bolsheviks before the First World War “confronted
Dzhugashvili-Stalin with the accusation that he was a
provocateur and an agent of the Security Police. And that
he had embezzled Party funds.” 26
From almost the beginning of the civil war in 1918, in
keeping with the Bolshevik tradition of operating under
false identities, the Cheka began sending officers and
agents under various disguises and pseudonyms behind
enemy lines to gather intelligence. By June 1919 the
number of these “illegals” was sufficiently large to
require the foundation of an illegals operations
department (later to become Directorate S of the KGB
First Chief Directorate). 27 KGB classified histories note
that henceforth “illegal” operations became “an
inseparable part of foreign intelligence.” On December
20, 1920, the third anniversary of the Cheka’s foundation,
a new foreign department (Innostranyi Otdel or INO) was
set up to direct all operations beyond Soviet borders.
During the early years of Soviet Russia, when the
Communist regime remained an international pariah, it
had few official missions abroad capable of providing
official cover for “legal” intelligence stations
(“residencies” in Cheka jargon) and thus relied chiefly on
illegals. As diplomatic and trade missions were
established in foreign capitals, each was given a “legal
residency” headed by a “resident” whose identity was
officially communicated only to the ambassador or head
of the mission. Illegals, sometimes grouped in “illegal
residencies,” operated without the benefit of diplomatic or
official cover and reported directly to INO in Moscow. 28
During the civil war of 1918-20, foreign intelligence
collection was of minor importance by comparison with
the Cheka’s role in assisting the victory of the Red Army
over its White enemies. Like the KGB later, the Cheka
liked to quantify its successes. In the autumn of 1919,
probably the turning point in the civil war, it proudly
claimed that during the first nineteen months of its
existence it had discovered and neutralized “412
underground anti-Soviet organizations.” 29 The Cheka’s
most effective method of dealing with opposition was
terror. Though its liking of quantification did not extend
to calculating the number of its victims, it is clear that the
Cheka enormously outstripped the Okhrana in both the
scale and the ferocity of its onslaught on political
opposition. In 1901, 4,113 Russians were in internal exile
for political crimes, of whom only 180 were on hard
labor. Executions for political crimes were limited to
those involved in actual or attempted assassinations.
During the civil war, by contrast, Cheka executions
probably numbered as many as 250,000, and may well
have exceeded the number of deaths in battle.



------


What the KGB files do not, of course, report are the
feelings of the illegals as they betrayed the sometimes
heroic survivors of the Prague Spring. Unlike the leaders
of the Soviet Union and the Soviet public, who had no
first-hand experience of the world outside the Soviet
Bloc, the illegals knew the West and the reality of life in
Czechoslovakia too well to have deluded themselves into
believing that they were engaged in a moral crusade to
defend socialist values against Western imperialism.
There were recurrent complaints in FCD Directorate S
that after postings abroad illegals sometimes returned with
an “incorrect” attitude towards life in the Soviet Union. 83
Occasionally their attitudes were so incorrect that their
careers were cut short. In 1966 the KGB liaison office in
Budapest virtuously reported to the Centre a series of
politically incorrect observations made by the female
illegal ERNA while returning from leave in Moscow to
her posting in Canada. Among the comments said to have
“shocked” her fellow KGB officers were the following:
In Moscow I was afraid to express my views frankly
on certain subjects. After all, I could see that they
thought that I had become more than a bit bourgeois.
Why did the Party allow a second cult of
personality to develop in respect of Khrushchev? I
cannot understand how Khrushchev could take
decisions on important Party and state matters all on
his own. And what were the other members of the
Central Committee doing? Were the consequences of
the cult of Stalin not still fresh in their minds?
What is the point now of launching so many
Sputniks? Would it not be better to attend to more
important things on earth? Twenty years have gone
by since the end of the war, but people do not have
the material goods which they need and deserve, and
which the humblest inhabitants of the West have
long enjoyed! 84
Very few illegals dared to voice such seditious comments
openly. But the fact that some undoubtedly thought such
thoughts cannot fail to have bred in them an increasing
cynicism, heightened in some cases by their experiences
in Czechoslovakia.

involved in McKinley assassination?



from Butterworth book:

	Azef, Evno. Born 1869. Recruited by Okhrana while an
impoverished student in 1893, made a career as agent and double
agent, rising in Socialist Revolutionary Party to e?ective
leadership of its Fighting Organisation, with role in provoking
assassinations. Exposed by Burtsev in 1908. Died Berlin, 1918.


	Parsons, Albert. Born 1848. Having led a militia in Texas against
the Ku Klux Klan, moved to Chicago and founded the
International Working People’s Association, incurring the hostility
of local industrialists. An anarchist, he addressed the Haymarket
Square on 4 May 1886, was sentenced to death for the bombing,
though absent, and hanged in November 1887. His wife, Lucy,
subsequently became a powerful speaker in the socialist cause.


	Evalenko, Aleksandr. Volunteered services to Okhrana in Russia
and emigrated to New York, where in?ltrated Society of Friends
of Russian Freedom as ‘Sergeyev’, destroying the movement from
within. Returned to London to continue work there.

	Harting, Baron Arkady. Born Abraham Hekkelman. Recruited to
the Okhrana while a student in St Petersburg, was adopted by
Rachkovsky and sent among émigrés under cover name of
Landesen. Contrived 1890 nihilist bomb plot in France, escaping
?ve-year sentence in absentia to re-establish himself as
respectable Arkady Harting in Belgium. Later appointed head of
the Foreign Okhrana, but past life exposed in 1909. Disappeared
to Belgium under official protection.


	Jagolkovsky, Cyprien. Deep-cover agent of the Paris Okhrana,
active in Switzerland, France and Belgium. Would later admit to
role in assassination of General Seliversto?, and played key role
in Liège bombings as Baron Ungern-Sternberg.


	Lopukhin, Alexei. Appointed director of the police department
by Plehve in 1892, became associate minister of the interior, but
fell from grace. Divulged details of Okhrana agents to Burtsev and
was exiled to post in Siberia.

United States: March: Documents forged by Okhrana circulating,
including one accusing Stepniak of selling out to England

active measures 100 years ago?

	...In exploring such a murky world, I have been unsurprised that
the evidence has been elusive and the o?cial paper trail often
sparse. How welcome would be the reappearance of the suitcase,
last seen in Paris during the 1930s, containing the private papers
of Peter Rachkovsky, the head of Russia’s foreign Okhrana and the
fulcrum for so much of the intrigue in the period. How
convenient if the ?les relating to the Okhrana’s activities in
London, and its relations with the American Pinkerton Agency, had not at some point been emptied; or, indeed, if the Belgian
cabinet had forgotten to instruct that key police reports should
disappear into secret dossiers, never to emerge again.


Pinkertons in with Okhrana?

	The world that this book sets out to portray is one of slippery
truths, where the key to success lies in the manipulation of
popular opinion, where masters of deception weave webs of such
complexity that they will ultimately trap themselves, and a
clinical paranoiac o?ers some of the most perspicacious
testimony.


Paris, 1908
In the eyes of the world, the group that assembled daily in Boris
Savinkov’s spartan Paris apartment in October 1908 would have
represented the most formidable concentration of terrorists
history had yet seen. The sixty-six-year-old Peter Kropotkin, a
descendant of the Rurik dynasty of early tsars, may have appeared
unthreatening, with his twinkling eyes, bushy white beard,
paunch and distinguished, bald dome of a head, but some
suspected him of having incited the 1901 assassination of
McKinley, the American president. With him sat his Russian
contemporaries, the revolutionaries Vera Figner and German
Lopatin, who had only recently emerged from the terrible
Schlüsselburg fortress, against whose vast walls they had listened
to the freezing waters of the River Neva and Lake Ladoga lap
ceaselessly for twenty years. Locked in solitary con?nement, in
cells designed to prevent any communication, they were there as
leaders of the organisation that had assassinated Tsar Alexander II
in 1881. And among the younger generation, scattered around the
room, there were others who could count grand dukes,
government ministers and police chiefs among their many
victims. But whatever the suspicions at the French Sûreté,
Scotland Yard or the Fontanka headquarters of the Russian
Okhrana, whose agents loitered in the street outside, their
purpose on this occasion was not to conspire, but to uncover the
conspiracies of others.

Thesis on Okhrana, Checka, and Bolsheviks


------

Sword and shield:

The most effective damage limitation measure taken by
the MGB after Bentley’s defection was to break off
contact with most of the wartime American agents whose
identities were known to her. As a result, Bentley’s many
leads resulted in not a single prosecution. The FBI began
its investigations too late to catch any of the spies named
by Bentley in the act of passing on classified information,
and it was unable to use evidence from wiretaps in court.
The Centre, however, failed to grasp the extent of the
legal obstacles which confronted the FBI and continued to
fear for several years that it would succeed in mounting a
major spy trial.


...Within a few years the Centre found both Mitchell and Martin considerably more trouble than they were worth. Predictably, both defectors rapidly became disillusioned with life in the Soviet Union. Martin, whom the Centre regarded as the more impressionable of the two, was gullible enough to believe a tale concocted by the KGB that they had both been sentenced in absentia to twenty years’ hard labor by a closed session of the US Supreme Court. He was eventually shown a bogus copy of the judgment in order to persuade him to put all thought of returning home out of his mind. Mitchell was more skeptical and by the 1970s appeared determined to leave. As chairman of the KGB, Yuri Andropov gave personal instructions that under no circumstances was either Mitchell or Martin to be allowed to go, for fear of deterring other potential defectors from the West. In a further attempt to deter Martin he was shown an article by Yuri Semyonov in Izvestia claiming that American agents had been found in possession of poison ampoules, and was led to believe that these were intended for Mitchell and himself. Mitchell correctly suspected that the story had been fabricated by the KGB. Galina Mitchell was also anxious to leave, but the KGB put pressure on her mother to persuade Galina to change her mind. After their applications for visas had been rebuffed by Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the United States, the Mitchells told the Soviet authorities on March 29, 1980 that they had given up their attempts to emigrate. 29 But there were persistent reports afterwards that Mitchell was still trying to leave.



...THOUGH THE FCD greatly expanded its sabotage
capability during the 1960s, it became increasingly
confused about the traditional speciality of its “special
actions” department—the liquidation of “enemies of the
people” abroad. The targets of most of the assassination
plots during the 1960s and 1970s recorded in the KGB
files seen by Mitrokhin concerned the KGB’s own
defectors, all of whom were sentenced to death for treason
during secret trials held in absentia. Despite the risks of
further bad publicity in the West if they were hunted
down, the Centre was determined not to allow the belief
to spread within KGB ranks that traitors could escape
their just deserts:
The KGB must intensify the spirit of hatred towards
the enemy and traitors. Significant harm is done by
the comforting theory that losses are inevitable in
wars between intelligence services. At meetings and
in reports, betrayals are sometimes called
compromises. Compromises, by which is meant
operational failures, are usually provoked by skillful
dangles by the enemy. Equating these two concepts
usually leads to the moral justification of traitors,
and creates an image of them as victims of the
intelligence skills of the enemy. Defectors do not go
unpunished. Their punishment is described in such
proverbs as: “The traitor Judas is hated everywhere.”
“A mercenary dog deserves a stake through the
heart” and “A traitor is his own murderer.” 58
Deep concern in the Centre at the damage done by
Anatoli Golitsyn’s defection from the Helsinki residency
in December 1961 strengthened its determination to deter
future defectors. Unaware of the confusion caused inside
the CIA by Golitsyn’s increasingly extravagant
conspiracy theories, the KGB regarded his defection as a
serious setback. 59 His case prompted a major review by
the Centre of its procedures for liquidating traitors outside
the Soviet Union. In November 1962 Semichastny, who
had succeeded Shelepin as KGB chairman, a year earlier,
approved a plan for “special actions” against a group of
“particularly dangerous traitors,” jointly drawn up by the
heads of the First and Second Chief Directorates,
Aleksandr Mikhailovich Sakharovsky and Oleg
Mikhailovich Gribanov:
As these traitors, who have given important state
secrets to the opponent and caused great political
damage to the USSR, have been sentenced to death
in their absence, this sentence will be carried out
abroad.


...LIKE THE OPERATIONS of the Thirteenth Department
during the Khrushchev era, those of Department V were
seriously compromised by defections. The most important
defector was the Line F officer in the London residency,
Oleg Adolfovich Lyalin, an expert in hand-to-hand
combat as well as a highly proficient marksman and
parachutist who had been recruited by MI5 as a defector-
in-place in the spring of 1971. During the six months
before he defected in September, Lyalin provided details
of KGB sabotage plans in London, Washington, Paris,
Bonn, Rome and other Western capitals. In addition to
compromising preparations for a number of peacetime
special actions, he revealed Department V’s hair-raising
contingency plans for operations during periods of
international crisis or conflict which would be carried out
by illegals, local agents and sabotage and intelligence
groups (DRGs) who would infiltrate each target
country.



...Dissident chess players were also the targets of major
KGB operations designed to prevent them winning
matches against the ideologically orthodox. During the
1978 world chess championship in the Philippines
between the Soviet world champion, Anatoli Karpov, and
the defector Viktor Korchnoi, the Centre assembled a
team of eighteen FCD operations officers to try to ensure
Korchnoi’s defeat. 57 KGB active measures may well have
determined the outcome of a close and controversial
championship. After draws in the first seven matches,
during which Korchnoi had the better of the play, Karpov
refused to shake hands with his opponent at the start of
the eighth. A furious Korchnoi, who was known to play
poorly when angry, lost the game. After twelve games the
scores were level, with Korchnoi once again appearing in
better form. During the next five games, however,
Korchnoi was thrown off his stride by the presence in the
front of the audience of a Russian hypnotist, Dr. Vladimir
Zukhar, who stared intently at him throughout the play.


lol


...POTENTIALLY THE MOST troublesome “ideological
subversion” with which the KGB had to contend during
the Cold War came from organized religion—especially
Christianity, which failed to wither away as the
Bolsheviks had hoped and expected. Though no other
political party was allowed to exist within the Communist
one-party state, Soviet rulers felt bound to proclaim a
hypocritical respect for freedom of religion. By the end of
the Second World War the attempt to eradicate religious
practice had given way to subtler forms of persecution
designed to ensure its steady decline and to discriminate
against the faithful. Within the Russian Orthodox church
the KGB was able to rely on an obedient hierarchy
permeated by its agents. The Centre’s main problems
came from other Christian churches and a courageous
minority of Orthodox priests who demanded an end to
religious persecution. For freedom of religion to make
progress within the Soviet Union, however, persecuted
Christians required strong support from the worldwide
church—in particular from the World Council of
Churches. They did not receive it. KGB agents in the
WCC were remarkably successful in persuading it to
concentrate on the sins of the imperialist West rather than
religious persecution in the Soviet Bloc. In 1975 agent
ADAMANT (Metropolitan Nikodim) was elected as one
of the WCC’s six presidents.

	In the backwaters of Eastern Europe, authorities working with the FBI have interrupted four attempts in the past five years by gangs with suspected Russian connections that sought to sell radioactive material to Middle Eastern extremists, The Associated Press has learned.

	The latest known case came in February this year, when a smuggler offered a huge cache of deadly cesium — enough to contaminate several city blocks — and specifically sought a buyer from the Islamic State group.

	Criminal organizations, some with ties to the Russian KGB’s successor agency, are driving a thriving black market in nuclear materials in the tiny and impoverished Eastern European country of Moldova, investigators say.

	AP INVESTIGATION: Nuclear black market seeks IS extremists

	...CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Over the pulsating beat at an exclusive nightclub, the arms smuggler made his pitch to a client: 2.5 million euros for enough radioactive cesium to contaminate several city blocks.

	It was earlier this year, and the two men were plotting their deal at an unlikely spot: the terrace of Cocos Prive, a dance club and sushi bar in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova.

	“You can make a dirty bomb, which would be perfect for the Islamic State,” the smuggler said. “If you have a connection with them, the business will go smoothly.”

	...The previously unpublicized case is one of at least four attempts in five years in which criminal networks with suspected Russian ties sought to sell radioactive material to extremists through Moldova, an investigation by The Associated Press has found. One investigation uncovered an attempt to sell bomb-grade uranium to a real buyer from the Middle East, the first known case of its kind.

	In that operation, wiretaps and interviews with investigators show, a middleman for the gang repeatedly ranted with hatred for America as he focused on smuggling the essential material for an atomic bomb and blueprints for a dirty bomb to a Middle Eastern buyer.

	...The sting operations involved a partnership between the FBI and a small group of Moldovan investigators, who over five years went from near total ignorance of the black market to wrapping up four sting operations. Informants and police posing as connected gangsters penetrated the smuggling networks, using old-fashioned undercover tactics as well as high-tech gear from radiation detectors to clothing threaded with recording devices.

	But their successes were undercut by striking shortcomings: Kingpins got away, and those arrested evaded long prison sentences, sometimes quickly returning to nuclear smuggling, AP found.

	...Several months later, a former KGB informant, Teodor Chetrus, called Malic’s source, the Moldovan businessman. Chetrus told him he had uranium to sell, but was looking for a Middle Eastern buyer.

	Unlike Malic’s first case, this one involved highly enriched uranium, the type that can be used to make a nuclear bomb.

	Even if it be assumed that the circumstances of 
the case which has just been taken do not warrant 
the application of Article 2 of the Anglo- Japanese 
Alliance, there can be not the slightest doubt that if 
Japan were to become engaged in a struggle with a 
great Naval Power, such as America, the longed-for 
opportunity would at once be seized to develop 
a strong Russian forward movement in Northern 
Korea, thus at once involving Japan in a double 
struggle. The position of Russia beyond Lake 
Baikal will have been made amply clear from the 
exhaustive descriptions given in the earlier part 
of the present volume. Russia, though she lost 
something by the late war, has gained in compactness 
in the Far East, and is now more able to act on 
land there as she can act in Europe — that is, in over- 
whelming force. Though she is by no means ready 
for another long land campaign, she is at least 
twice or even three times as ready as she was at the 
beginning of the year 1904. She would leave it to 
Japan to violate the neutral territory of Manchuria 
by massing large forces of men in the Japanese 
railway zone ; and once such a violation had taken 
place, ten divisions of Chinese troops might introduce 
still another element into the problem.

When the Nationalist Government turned its anti-foreign 
guns on Manchuria, it underestimated the importance which 
Japan attached to its vital interests there. Japan recognized 
the growing strength of Soviet Russia under its five-year plan 
and had no desire to remain dormant while Russia girded its 
loins for a possible renewed advance towards warm-water 
ports in Liaotung. Japan resented the love-feast between the 
Young Marshal and the Kuomintang, and opined that a strong 
move into Manchuria would have the double-barrelled effect 
of stopping both the Russian and the Chinese advances. Of 
course, it is arguable to contend that there is no single "Japan," 
and that there was no coolly-calculated reasoned design on 
anyone's part to move into Manchuria. On the contrary, it is 
quite patent that any group in direction of Japan's policy 
must have appreciated the effect upon Russia and China which 



JAPAN IN CHINA 103 

any occupation of Manchuria would have. It might have been 
accident or good fortune which spread the armies of Japan 
over the whole of Northeast China in just five months after 
the Mukden incident, but the drive was so well organized, so 
precise, and so rapid, that it evidences conscious backstage 
direction. 


...Japanese secret societies, which are no more secret than 
the Knights of Columbus or the Masonic organizations in the 
United States, always attract huge numbers of followers, 
including chauvinists, ronins, hooligans, politicians and gentle- 
men. They are usually dedicated to the ideals of ultra-national- 
ism and form the civilian counterpart of the radical elements 
in the army. Baron Hiranuma's Kokuhonsha, the Roninkai, 
the Jimmu, the Native Land, Mr. Hirota's Black Dragon So- 
ciety, and any number of ex-service men's associations are 
well known for their fanatical support of positive action. 
They have frequently forced appointment of their members 
to outstanding posts. 1 

The "militarists" are extremely powerful, but they have 
not escaped the clutches of internal turmoil. There are almost 
as many factions as there are outstanding leaders, but two or 
three of these factions have developed contradictory philoso- 
phies. Some of the old-school descendants of the samurai 
object strenuously to the sabre-rattlers of the ilk of General 
Araki. The cooler heads are in the background now while 
Generals Mmarni, Uyeda, Sugiyama, Hata and Itagaki exert 
every possible effort to achieve Japan's place in the sun. 

These champions of the younger officers are ruthless in 
discipline of themselves and their soldiers, puritanical in their 
concept of the way of life, mystical in their devotion to the 
symbolism of the Emperor, scornful in their attitude towards 
wealth, and arrogant in their relations with third countries. 
They flout the trappings of democracy within their own 
country; they treat the bureaucrats and the politicians as so 
much scum; they tolerate the industrialists only when it suits 
their purposes; but they are keenly conscious of peasant suf- 
ferings. Peasants provide soldiers and a strong peasantry 
makes a strong nation. When the militarists embark upon a 
policy, they leave it to others to count the costs and to smooth 
the ruffled feelings of those who have been offended. They

oppose the trade unions, all evidences of Marxianism or Com- 
munism, and economic liberalism of any description. In their 
ultra-fascistic ranks there is always some hothead who is 
willing to assassinate the exponent of contradictory opinions. 
In their favor, they are not cowards and they act for what 
they conceive to be the fulfillment of their patriotic duty. 
They are in complete control of Japan's foreign policy. 



...The Japanese troops occupied Mukden with such speed 
that they did not give the Chinese authorities much time to 
weigh the pros and cons of the situation. China had to act 
and to act quickly, and it acted on the advice of its trusted 
Australian adviser, Mr. W. H. Donald, "China's Number One 
White Boy." He reasoned that the Chinese were no military 
match for the Japanese, so armed resistance would be futile. 
He suggested a policy of non-resistance accompanied by an 
immediate appeal to the League of Nations. He believed that 
within a week at the most, the League would brand the Jap- 
anese as aggressors and set in motion the machinery which had 
been designed to protect the interests of the victim.

...When the brakes were taken off in Eastern Asia in 1931, 
the whole lumbering machine of international peace started 
on its dizzy careening course down hill The Disarmament 
Conference evaporated in clouds of oratory, Mussolini sent 
his Fascist legions into Ethiopia, and Hitler announced the 
formation of his conscript army. Spain became the scene of 
civil war and international intrigue, German troops reoccu- 
pied the Rhincland, and the competitive race in naval arma- 
ments got under way. National economies strained after 
autarchy, and military necessity shot national budgets sky- 
high. Every little incident grew into a question of honor, 
propaganda machines extolled friends and damned enemies, 
nerves became tense, and war awaited its time and opportu- 
nity. Germany took over Czechoslovakia, Italy invaded Al- 
bania, and Jewish families got out of Poland, Hungary and 
southeastern Europe as fast as they could obtain visas for the 
United States or some other haven. Japanese planes continued

http://www.pieria.co.uk/articles/interview_with_sean_mcmeekin
	You have written three books about the origins of the First World War.  What makes this topic so compelling?

	The biggest draw for me as a historian is the stakes.  The war of 1914 had such profound, and predominantly negative, consequences -- four years of industrial-scale slaughter all but destroying western faith in human progress, the violent break-up of empires which had endured for centuries, the bloodletting begat by the Russian Revolution and Civil War, the rise of fascism, Nazism, and all the rest.  And yet the war, I have come to learn, did not have to happen, at least when and in the manner that it did.  Many structural factors -- industrialization and the arms race, empires and alliances, nationalism and the spread of near-universal military service across Europe -- helped produce the carnage of 1914-1918 once the Great War broke out, but they did not cause the war, which could easily have been avoided had various contingent events, actions and reactions not transpired precisely they way they did in 1914.

	...It is only in the last decade or two that historians have rediscovered the actual events of 1914.  There are two obvious reasons for this.  The terrible wars in the former Yugoslavia reminded everyone of the importance of the Balkans.  After 9/11, it was not so easy to dismiss the importance of the act of terrorism in Sarajevo which unleashed the furies of war in 1914.  These lessons, along with the upcoming centennial, have brought forth a cornucopia of great new work on the subject.  Albertini has been rediscovered; new evidence has emerged from the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans; and so historians now tell the story with much more nuance.  The war may not have been an “accident,” but it was clearly contingent on various avoidable events, beginning with the assassination itself.  Whatever historians’ views on each power’s responsibility, it is no longer really tenable to explain the outbreak of war in 1914 as some kind of structurally pre-determined event.


	... Had Gavrilo Princip missed, or had Archduke Francis Ferdinand left Sarajevo after the first failed assassination attempt (as his security detail advised), or had his driver not taken a wrong turn, would a World War broken out at some later date?  In other words, was the assassination a spark that ignited an unstable international situation that would have probably exploded at some later date or can we just as easily imagine a Europe that would have remained peaceful for another 99 years? 

	This is one of the great counterfactuals of modern history.  I do believe that, had Princip missed or the Archduke taken more sensible precautions for his own safety after the failed bombing attempt, nearly all    subsequent history would have taken a different path. 

	...Might there have been a general European conflagration at some future point?  One can never rule out worst-case scenarios, but there is nothing which would have made war any more likely than in the years before 1914, absent the precise sequence of events which transpired following Sarajevo


	...So France wanted Alsace, Russia wanted the Straits, Germany had some vague desire for Lebensraum and a vague fear of encirclement, and Britain was thinking about Home Rule for Ireland. Not very good reasons to plunge a peaceful and prosperous Europe into hell. And yet, the people of Europe went to war in August 1914 with joy and brass bands and parades. Was it 99 years of peace that lulled them into war? Or an atavistic desire for violence and boredom with bourgeois prosperity?

	Few historians still see things quite this way.  There were a few parades, many volunteered to take up arms, and open opposition to the draft was rare, but the idea that the common people of Europe all marched off happily to war is no longer tenable.  Entire books have been written by specialists to debunk "the myth of war enthusiasm," most recently by Mike Neiberg (Dance of the Furies.  Europe and the Outbreak of World War I, Harvard 2011).  Certainly many young men (most famously Hitler) welcomed the break from dull routine, the cameradie of military life and so on:  but most people seem to have reacted to the war's outbreak more with trepidation and terror than bloodlust. 

	And this, mind you, is after the war began, with the national press in each belligerent already baying for blood.  In its origins, the war of 1914 was almost purely a "Cabinet war," with even the invocation of "public opinion" (let alone the real thing) playing next to no role in the decisions to mobilize (with the curious exception of Russia, the least democratic and nationalist-patriotic of all the initial belligerents). 

	The fact that the war of 1914 was a Cabinet war does not make the story any less troubling, however.  To me, it is, if anything, more unsettling that a conflict of such world-shattering proportions could be conjured up by such a small handful of men. 


	...My argument is not really that Russia is more responsible for the outbreak of war than the other two, but rather that the war which actually resulted in August 1914 was the war Russian policymakers preferred, not the one the Austrians or Germans wanted.


	...As for why Poincaré took such a hard line, and encouraged Russia's early mobilization -- that remains one of the great questions of the July crisis.


	...Whatever the merits of Bethmann's policies in July 1914, and I think they were disastrous, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the ultimate German nightmare of "encirclement" actually came true in 1914.  Like cornered animals, the Germans lashed out, and they have much to answer for.  But so, too, do the Bosnian Serb terrorists who assassinated Franz Ferdinand, the Austrian leaders who pushed for a war with Serbia, the statesmen in Paris and St. Petersburg who capitalized on the inept diplomacy of Berlin and Vienna to corner the Germans, and those in London who turned the European conflict into a world war.  It did not have to happen.

	In France a social Darwinist vision of war was evident in the work of the major military theorist of the time, Ferdinand Foch. Foch, a key participant in the new French War College, copied and admired many of the Darwinist themes evident in von der Goltz and Bernhardi. The result was the building of a consensus about the next war determined by positive normative assupmtions. In short, war was seen to be good for human progress.

Now, when the authorities concentrated the business of helping the starving in their hands, leaving no opportunity for public organizations to participate in it, destroying the eyelids, putting the order on themselves. Russian Orthodox Church. The active participation of the church in the fight against hunger was traditional. But this tradition was later subjected to destruction.


Kalinin seems like a bad person to put in charge of combating famine


	...VI Lenin, L.D.Trotsky, I.V.Stalin, G.E. Zinoviev, P. A. Krasikov, E.M. Yaroslavsky and some other prominent members of the party sharply spoke against the participation of the church in helping the starving. Attempts by Patriarch Tikhon to introduce the activities of the church in this direction into a legal framework, to approve the "Regulations on the Church Committee" came across a dead Kremlin wall, which it was not immediately able to break through. The formal grounds for refusing to affirm the provision was the prohibition of charitable activities to all religious organizations by the instruction of the People's Commissariat of August 30, 1918. There was no response to the repeated appeal of Patriarch Tikhon addressed directly to Kalinin on August 31, 1921. The delay in replying to the patriarch was connected with a stubborn the struggle for the participation of the church in helping the starving population of Russia.


Lenin didn't want church to help starving for some reason


	...Contrary to the aspirations of the authorities to limit or even ban churches from helping the starving people by February 1922, it collected more than 8 million 926 thousand rubles, not counting jewelry, gold coins and food aid for the hungry.

	So, all the attempts of the church to find variants of a compromise with the state in the joint struggle against hunger were met by the resistance of the authorities, based on the principles of the relationship of the proletarian state with the church proclaimed in 1918. Gradually, the church's initiatives were rejected, it lost one position after another. The next step was the closure of the Church Committee and the transfer of all collected valuables to the Pomgol Central Committee.

	Thus, the foundation of voluntary cooperation with the state in the fight against hunger created by the church was destroyed. The authorities did not need an ally church, but an opponent church. Then, obviously, the idea was born to use hunger as an excuse for defeating the church. It is difficult to agree with those researchers who still believe that the seizure of church values ​​was conceived as one of the ways to solve the problem of hunger. Playing on the people's disaster, you could blame the church for concealing the means that could save thousands of lives, provoke anger towards the church and lead to the need to expropriate its values ​​for people's needs. In this sense, hunger was the best reason. Realizing that the people will not allow to rob churches and avoid bloodshed, it will be possible to blame the church for bloodshed and use it to destroy it. Therefore shots in Shuya will sound like a signal to the beginning of a new "class battle". Only in this way does the meaning of the prohibitions of the church itself become clear in the fight against hunger.


wanted to use the famine to destroy the church somehow? not exactly clear


	...At the same time, the media continued to be aggravated, the horrors of hunger were described. The press was called upon to set up public opinion against the church, with the obvious purpose of presenting it almost as a defendant for the suffering of millions of hungry people. This prepared a double blow-not only confiscating from the church all the values ​​that had been collected and stored for centuries, but also blaming it for the famine, for the inability of the authorities to cope with the disaster.

	The reaction of Patriarch Tikhon to the adoption of the decree was obvious. As early as February 19, 1922, at the time of the preparation of the decree, Patriarch Tikhon addressed an appeal in which he proposed a solution that would ensure the collection of necessary funds for hunger and the preservation of church objects necessary for the worship, representing values ​​of general cultural significance: , who do not have liturgical use "24.

Stalin also doing things that cause starvation in addition to holodomor, Lysenkoism

	IN agonised Russian mother writes to the Moscow newspaper, Pravda, as follows:

		“I am a widow with four children, and no one in the world to help me. My oldest child is fourteen, the youngest seven. We have had nothing to eat for days, and I see my children growing weaker and weaker. There is no food to be had. The youngest lay sick in bed, dying. In the night my eldest child came to me and said that we must kill the little one for the sake of the rest, and give them something to eat. I told her it could not be, but then I saw the pinched faces of the three starving little ones, and I thought that in any case, the youngest must die soon, for we had no means to save her. I consented, and in the night my oldest girl and I went quietly while the others slept, and with a knife we killed and cut up the body of my youngest. Now there is food for the other children, but I cannot eat, knowing what it is. I write to you to ask if I have done wrong, and to offer myself for punishment.”

	This is but one of a hundred similar instances occurring daily in the famine region of Russia, where for nine months hunger has raged, supplemented by bitter cold and virulent epidemics. Nineteen million people have been affected by this great catastrophe, which will rank among the worst in history. And, to add to the horror of hunger, cold, disease, pestilence and suffering of every description—cannibalism! A civilized people, once the gentlest, most laughter-loving and happiest in the family of nations, has reverted to barbarism. Mothers are secretly killing their children; families are feeding on the flesh of those who have died; human ghouls are digging up the frozen corpses that have been interred, to save themselves from death.

	Who is responsible for these horrors?

	The thousand-throated enemies of Russia will cry “the Bolsheviks.”


	But those who know the truth will reply, “Capitalism.”

	German speakers, pro-German sympathies in its officer 
corps, and the presence of an Argentinian military 
purchasing mission in Berlin until 1944, helped to 
persuade the Centre that Argentina was a major Nazi 
base. Though this belief was greatly exaggerated, it was 
shared by OSS, the US wartime foreign intelligence 
agency, which reported that Dr. Ramon Castillo, president 
of Argentina from 1941 to 1943, was in the pay of 
Hitler.^^ Such reports, passed on to the Centre by its 
agents in OSS and the State Department,^^ doubtless 
reinforced Moscow’s suspicions of Nazi plots in 
Argentina. 


Hitler escape to Argentina confirmed


	...1. As late as 1990 Valentin Falin, head of the 
International Department of the Central Committee, 
which was largely responsible for determining foreign 
intelligence requirements, claimed that intelligence 
reports in 1943 showed that some in Washington as well 
as in London were considering “the possibility of 
terminating the coalition with the Soviet Union and 
reaching an accord with Nazi Germany, or with the Nazi 
Generals, on the question of waging a joint war against 
the Soviet Union”: 

Therefore when we talk about Stalin’s distrust with 
regard to Churchill, at a certain stage towards those 
surrounding Roosevelt, not so much towards 
Roosevelt himself, we should pay attention to the 
fact that he based this mistrust on a very precise 
knowledge of specific facts. 


Churchill thinking about joining Nazis?


	...After the Second World War the NKVD and its 
successor, the MGB, played a central role in the creation 
of the new Soviet empire in eastern and central Europe. 
Their role, according to a sanctimonious Soviet official 
history, was to “help the people of liberated countries in 
establishing and strengthening a free domestic form of 
govemmenf’^^ — in other words, to construct a series of 
obedient one-party states along the Soviet Union’s 
western borders. Throughout the Soviet Bloc, security and 
intelligence services, newly created in the image of the 
MGB, played a crucial part in the establishment of 
Stalinist regimes. Informers in the German Democratic 
Republic were seven times more numerous even than in 
Nazi Germany. As in East Germany, many of the leaders 
of the new one-party states were not merely loyal 
Stalinists but also former Soviet agents.
