>POMPEO: There was an e-mail that was from Mr. Blumenthal and (inaudible) before that, also discussing the same situation. Do you know who Mark Turrey (ph) is?

>CLINTON: No, I don't recall that I know who that is.

>POMPEO: He was a private trafficker in weapons. He was working with Mr. Stevens and attempting to develop an authorization with the State Department so that he could in fact deliver those weapons into Libya. Does that -- any of that ring a bell to you?

>CLINTON: No, it does not.

>POMPEO: So you never saw the e-mail that was from Mr. Stevens to -- I think it went to Mr. Sullivan, where he says to Mr. Turrey (ph), this is Mr. Stevens now, says to Mr. Turrey (ph): "Thank you for this information" -- this information about his attempts to get authority to ship arms into Libya. He says, "Thank you for this information. I'll keep it in mind and share it with my colleagues in Washington. Regards, Chris." Actually, "regards, Chris Stevens."

>CLINTON: I -- I don't know anything about that specifically. I do know that you're referring to a document, and if you are, could you tell us what tab it's at?

>POMPEO: Yes, ma'am. I'm not certain it's in there as a tab, but I'm happy to provide it to you.

>(CROSSTALK)

>CLINTON: Well, it's a little difficult to answer questions about documents we don't have. But I can -- I can answer you. Whatever was considered either out of politeness or out of interest, there was not any action taken so far as I know.

>BY ALEXANDER BOLTON - 07/25/14 10:30 AM EDT

>Senior White House advisers are taking very seriously the possibility that Republicans in Congress will try to impeach President Obama, especially if he takes executive action to slow deportations.

>Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Obama, said Friday that the White House is taking the prospect of impeachment in the GOP-controlled House more seriously than many others in Washington, who see it as unlikely.

>...“I saw a poll today that had a huge portion of the Republican Party base saying they supported impeaching the president. A lot of people in this town laugh that off. I would not discount that possibility,” he told reporters Friday at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.

>Pfeiffer said Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) decision to file a lawsuit against Obama over his use of executive actions increased the chance of impeachment proceedings in the future.

>He said that possibility could become more likely if Obama takes executive action to halt the deportations of illegal immigrants who have strong ties to the United States, such as those who have family members who are U.S. citizens.

>“I think Speaker Boehner, by going down the path of this lawsuit, has opened the door to Republicans possibly considering impeachment at some point in the future,” he said.

>First, host Bill O’Reilly asked Mr. Gowdy what he thought of the argument made by Judge Andrew Napolitano — that Mr. Obama’s proposed executive orders to grant amnesty to millions of illegals would rise to the level of an impeachable offense, The Daily Caller reported.

>“What about [that?] … That this is an impeachable situation because it does go against Congress making the laws, because the president is making a new law,” Mr. O’Reilly said. “And the new law says that if you have children who are American citizens even though you yourself are an illegal undocumented person, you can stay in this country. That supersedes the old law. Napolitano claims it’s unconstitutional and impeachable. Do you see anybody going down that road in the House?”

>Frank Marshall Davis: Obama’s ‘Communist mentor’?
> 
>...we reached out to Cliff Kincaid, president of America’s Survival, a group that seeks to expose Communist and Marxist influences. It is research from Kincaid and a few others that has shaped the opinion of critics who believe Obama adopted radical, socialist ideologies under Davis’s mentorship. Davis was a journalist and activist who was associated with the Communist Party in the 1930s and 1940s.

>We interviewed Kincaid at the Conservative Political Action Conference. When The Fact Checker arrived, Kincaid had been waiting with four of his peers, stacks of documents and a video camera pointed at an empty seat saved for us.

>“The Frank in Obama’s book, ‘Dreams from My Father,’ is Frank Marshall Davis,” Kincaid said. “You don’t dispute that.”

>“It has been admitted,” he continued, “except that here we are, to be honest with you, seven years after we broke this story. … The Washington Post has not reported the facts about Obama’s relationship with Frank Marshall Davis. That’s why I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity so you can hear directly from us and see the material we have.”

>He and his peers do not outwardly label Obama a Communist, but believe Communist influences have been played down by the media. Obama has shown to be an ineffective Communist, if he were one. He has failed to unravel the capitalist system over the past six years that he has held the most powerful position in the world — though, as Obama says, “interesting things happen in the fourth quarter.”


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/14/obama-russia-election-interference-241547
>The Obama administration received multiple warnings from national security officials between 2014 and 2016 that the Kremlin was ramping up its intelligence operations and building disinformation networks it could use to disrupt the U.S. political system, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials.

>As early as 2014, the administration received a report that quoted a well-connected Russian source as saying that the Kremlin was building a disinformation arm that could be used to interfere in Western democracies. The report, according to an official familiar with it, included a quote from the Russian source telling U.S. officials in Moscow, "You have no idea how extensive these networks are in Europe ... and in the U.S., Russia has penetrated media organizations, lobbying firms, political parties, governments and militaries in all of these places."

>...There was no explicit warning of a threat to U.S. elections, but the official said some diplomats and national security officials in Moscow felt the administration was too quick to dismiss the possibility that the Kremlin incursions could reach the United States.

>“Even if the Russians and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin had these ambitions, they were doubtful of their capacity to execute them,” the official said of the Obama administration.

>Former White House officials, requesting anonymity to discuss intelligence reporting, confirmed that the administration began receiving increased traffic in 2014 about Russian disinformation and covert influence in campaigns, but said they did not recall receiving that specific warning about Russian inroads in the United States.

>The scandal over an alleged Russian spy ring erupted at an awkward time for a White House that has staked its foreign policy record on improved cooperation with Moscow, but it appeared unlikely to do lasting damage to U.S.-Russian relations.

>The administration sought to dampen tensions, while the Russian government offered the conciliatory hope Tuesday that U.S. authorities would "show proper understanding, taking into account the positive character of the current stage of development of Russian-American relations."

>The White House response was notably restrained following the dramatic announcement that 11 people assigned a decade or more to illegally infiltrate American society had been arrested. They are accused of using fake names and claims of U.S. citizenship to burrow into U.S. society and ferret out intelligence as Russian "illegals" — spies operating without diplomatic cover.

>...Obama was asked about the matter by reporters twice Tuesday. He declined to comment both times.

>...President Obama made clear when he announced the new way forward with Russia 18 months ago that there would be issues the U.S. and Russia would disagree on, and that the U.S. "should see this spying issue in that context."


http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/10/16/how-the-russian-reset-explains-obamas-foreign-policy/
>Obama first spoke of "reset" less than 12 months after Russia invaded Georgia, a U.S. friend and partner. Soon after that, the Russian-built Bushehr nuclear reactor in Iran began operations. As rebels tried to bring down the government of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad in early 2011, Russia supplied the Syrian dictator with military equipment by sea. Reuters reports that Moscow sold Damascus $1 billion dollars of military hardware since the uprising began.


http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/29/white-house-downplays-russian-agent-plot-says-obama-knew-medvedev-visit.html
>State Department spokesman Phil Gordon went further, saying nobody should be surprised that secret Russian agents are operating in the country. He suggested the Justice Department, which announced the arrests Monday, was not on the same page as the State Department. 

>"I think the timing underscores that the Department of Justice is in a different channel," Gordon said, clarifying that the timetable was "appropriate" for Justice, while State is "moving on the diplomatic issues." 

>Gordon said the arrests merely show that the two countries have not yet reached the level of "trust and cooperation" where they can be completely open with one another. 

>"I don't think anyone in this room is shocked to have discovered that. And so yes, you know, we're moving towards a more trusting relationship. We're beyond the Cold War. I think our relations absolutely demonstrate that. But as I say, I don't think anyone was hugely shocked to know that some vestiges of old attempts to use intelligence are still there," he said. 

>The statements appeared to clash with comments from Justice officials, one of whom described the charges as "the tip of the iceberg" of a Russian intelligence conspiracy against the United States. 

>Officials announced an 11th arrest Tuesday after they announced 10 arrests on Monday. While the Russian government dismissed the allegations, the federal complaints unsealed Monday described a long-term plot in which Russian agents assumed false identities in the United States with the goal of eventually infiltrating "policymaking circles" in the U.S.


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/14/obama-russia-election-interference-241547
>...Yet the administration still was reluctant to engage in more forceful counterintelligence strategies against the Kremlin, including more aggressively tracking and tailing Russian operatives within the United States, according to five of the officials who spoke to POLITICO.

>Those outside the White House said they received frustrating mixed messages: The White House would subsequently dismiss Moscow’s capabilities while also citing fear of an escalation with Putin.


http://time.com/4828306/russian-hacking-election-widespread-private-data/
>The hacking of state and local election databases in 2016 was more extensive than previously reported, including at least one successful attempt to alter voter information, and the theft of thousands of voter records that contain private information like partial Social Security numbers, current and former officials tell TIME.

>...The Russian efforts against state and local databases were so widespread that top Obama administration cyber-security officials assumed that by Election Day Moscow’s agents had probed all 50 states. “At first it was one state, then three, then five, then a dozen,” says Anthony Ferrante, a former FBI cybersecurity official and member of the White House team charged with preparedness and response to the cyber intrusion. At that point, says Michael Daniel, who led the White House effort to secure the vote against the Russian intrusions, “We had to assume that they actually tried to at least rattle the doorknobs on all 50, and we just happened to find them in a few of them."

>...we decided to take a definitive look at Davis’s Communist Party activities and his relationship with Obama, based on competing research by those who have spent years trying to posthumously vindicate or indict Davis.

>...His writings caught the attention of the FBI, which began tracking him in the 1930s, according to FBI records that Kincaid obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI was concerned with his role as executive editor of the Associated Negro Press, through which agents believed he was spreading Communist propaganda to the outlet’s members.

>Informants told the FBI that Davis was a member of the party and organized its marches. ...The House Committee on Un-American Activities was well aware of Davis by the late 1940s. Davis’s last identification as a Communist Party member was in 1952, and he stopped being active with the Hawaii Civil Rights Congress in 1956, the file says. When Davis took the Fifth Amendment in front of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1956, agents were suspicious.

>So the FBI continued to track him into the 1960s and did not officially remove him from the Security Index until 1963.

>...The purpose of the mission, initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was to visit the Soviet Union’s Far East and Central Asia as goodwill envoys

>...Interestingly, Wallace’s trip attracted FBI attention. On May 12, 1944, agent D. M. Ladd reported a conversation between Wallace and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Gromyko regarding Soviet visas to J. Edgar Hoover. Gromyko advised  Wallace “to issue visas to anyone whom Wallace desired to take with him.

>...The book that Wallace wrote about the trip, Soviet Asian Mission, published in 1946, triggered a storm of criticism, especially when it became clear he had apparently been completely duped by the Soviets. Both Wallace and Lattimore considered the NKVD organization, Dalstroi (an acronym of a Russian phrase meaning ”Far North Construction Trust”), “a combination TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] and Hudson’s Bay Company.”

>Later Sgovio asked a rhetorical question: “Looking back, I often wonder . . . what it would be like [in Dalstroi]—were it not for American Lend-Lease products and equipment . . . Everything around us was American—products, machinery, tools, Studebaker trucks, steam shovels, Diamond bull-dozers

>But what was that world of Kolyma, where Shalamov survived for so long? How did people live and die there? In his writings, Shalamov gives some idea of the bleak, fearful hoplessness of Kolyma. In one poignant passage, he describes how the Soviets used an American bulldozer during World War II under Lend-Lease:

>>The mountain had been laid bare and transformed into a gigantic stage for a camp mystery play.

>>A grave, a mass grave, a stone pit stuffed full with undecaying corpses of 1938 was sliding down the side of the hill, revealing the secret of Kolyma.

>>In Kolyma, bodies are not given over to earth, but to stone. Stone keeps secrets and reveals them. The permafrost keeps and reveals secrets. All of our loved ones who died in Kolyma, all of those who were shot, beaten to death, sucked dry by starvation, can still be recognized even after tens of years. There were no gas furnaces in Kolyma. The corpses wait in stone, in the permafrost.

>>In 1938 entire work gangs dug such graves, constantly drilling, exploding, deepening the enormous gray, hard, cold stone pits. Digging graves in 1938 was easy work; there was no "assignment," no "norm" calculated to kill a man with a 14-hour working day. It was easier to dig graves than to stand in rubber galoshes over bare feet in the icy waters where they mined gold--the "basic unit of production," the "first of all metal."

>>These graves, enormous stone pits, were filled to the brim with corpses. The bodies had not decayed; they were just bare skeletons over which stretched dirty, scratched skin bitten all over by lice.

>>...Now the mountain was laid bare, and its secret was revealed. The grave "opened," and the dead men slid down the stony slope. Near the tractor road an enormous new common grave was dug. Who had dug it? No one was taken from the barracks for this work. It was enormous, and I and my companions knew that if we were to freeze and die, place would be found for us in this new grave, this housewarming for dead men.

>>The bulldozer scraped up the frozen bodies, thousands of bodies of thousands of skeleton-like corpses. Nothing had decayed: the twisted fingers, the pus-filled toes which were reduced to mere stumps after frostbite, the dry skin scratched bloody and eyes burning with a hungry gleam.

>In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A. Wallace's bid for the President of the United States, during which Robeson traveled to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him.

>...Robeson traveled to Moscow in June, and was unable to find Itzik Feffer. He let Soviet authorities know that he wanted to see him. Reluctant to lose Robeson as a propagandist for the Soviet Union, the Soviets brought Feffer from prison to him. Feffer told him that Mikhoels had been murdered, and he would be summarily executed. To protect the Soviet Union's reputation, and to keep the right wing of the United States from gaining the moral high ground, Robeson denied that any persecution existed in the Soviet Union, and kept the meeting secret for the rest of his life

>DAVIS was a regular columnist for the "Honolulu Record" until May 1957. He was active in the last Communist Party front group, the Hawaii Civil Rights Congress, which went out of existence in the fall of 1956. DAVIS also refused to testify before the Senate Internal Securty Subcommittee in November 1956. DAVIS was a member of the Communist Party until it became inactive in 1952.


https://archive.org/stream/FrankMarshallDavisFBIFile/Frank%20Marshall%20Davis%20007#page/n25/mode/2up
>Davis arrived in Honolulu on 12/8/48 and prior to that time had been closely associated with top leaders of Dsitrct 8, CPA, in CGO for several years. Davis had been executive editor of the "Chicago Star", a since defunct Communist weekly newspaper. He had been active in the AF in CGO and had taught in the ALS, a CP front in CGO.

>...On 3/25/49, Frank Marshall Davis, a CP member, summoned [REDACTED], leader of the pro-Communist faction of the Hon. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to his (Davis') apartment in Hon. to read a letter from [REDACTED], NAACP, New York City. The letter concerned the Hawaii NAACP Branch and enclosed letters from Hawaiian citizens to the NAACP in New York City which demanded the charter of the Hawaii NAACP be revoked because of Communist infiltration attempts.

>...In a letter dated 9/26/49 addressed to [REDACTED], National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, New York 18, N.Y., [REDACTED] stated he had been at an NAACP election meeting (date not stated), at which Frank Marshall Davis "suddenly appeared on the scene to propagandize the membership about our 'racial problems' in Hawaii. He had just sneaked in on a boat, and presto, was an 'expert' on racial problems in Hawaii. Comrade Davis was supported by others who recently 'sneaked' into the organization with the avowed intent and purpose of converting it into a front for the Stalinist line."

>No other person can claim the title of Obama “mentor” than Davis, wrote Paul Kengor in “The Communist,” his book about Davis and Obama. “Frank is a lasting, permanent influence, an integral part of Obama’s sojourn,” he wrote.

>...Obama sought advice from Davis as a college freshman — the last known meeting between the two. As Obama became a community organizer in college and later grappled with the challenges of race and poverty in Chicago, he visualized Davis and asked, “What would Frank do? What would Frank think?” Kengor wrote. Obama does refer to Davis several times in his book when listing people who influenced his understanding of his black identity.

>...Why do Kincaid and others believe that the relationship with Davis shaped Obama more than, say, his own experiences and others he met throughout his life? Why does it matter that he met Davis as a teen? It’s that Davis was a “hard-core member” of the Communist Party and hated America and instilled those thoughts in Obama, Kincaid said. Obama also has gone on to surround himself with others with radical left views, Kincaid said.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright_controversy
>The Jeremiah Wright controversy gained national attention in the United States, in March 2008 when ABC News, after reviewing dozens of U.S. Presidential candidate Barack Obama's pastor Jeremiah Wright's sermons, excerpted parts which were subject to intense media scrutiny. Wright is a retired senior pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago and former pastor of President Obama. Obama denounced the statements in question, but critics continued to press the issue of his relationship with Wright. In response to this, he gave a speech titled "A More Perfect Union", in which he sought to place Wright's comments in a historical and sociological context.

>...Wright then commented on God and government:

>>...America failed. She put them in chains, the government put them on slave quarters, put them on auction blocks, put them in cotton field, put them in inferior schools, put them in substandard housing, put them in scientific experiments, put them in the lowest paying jobs, put them outside the equal protection of the law, kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness. The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing "God Bless America". No, no, no, not God Bless America. God damn America — that's in the Bible — for killing innocent people. God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme.

>Frank Marshall Davis, alleged Communist, was early influence on Barack Obama

>Although identified only as Frank in Mr Obama’s memoir Dreams from My Father, it has now been established that he was Frank Marshall Davis, a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the Communist Party in the 1950s.

>Mr Davis moved to Honolulu from Chicago in 1948 with his second wife Helen Canfield, a white socialite, at the suggestion of his friend the actor Paul Robeson, who advised them that there would be more tolerance of a mixed race couple in Hawaii than on the American mainland.

>...While his mother was in Indonesia during part of his teenage years, Mr Obama lived with his white grandparents. Mrs Weatherly-Williams said that the poet was first introduced to the future Democratic presidential candidate in 1970 at the age of 10. 

>...Maya Soetoro-Ng, Obama's half-sister, told the Associated Press recently that her grandfather had seen Mr Davis was “a point of connection, a bridge if you will, to the larger African-American experience for my brother".

>In his memoir, Mr Obama recounts how he visited Mr Davis on several occasions, apparently at junctures when he was grappling with racial issues, to seek his counsel.

>Barack Obama

>...There was one exception, a poet named Frank who lived in a dilapidated house in a run-down section of Waikiki. He had enjoyed some modest notoriety once, was a contemporary of Richard Wright and Langston Hughes during his years in Chicago-Gramps once showed me some of his work anthologized in a book of black poetry. But by the time I met Frank he must have been pushing eighty, with a big, dewlapped face and an ill-kempt gray Afro that made him look like an old, shaggy-maned lion. He would read us his poetry whenever we stopped by his house, sharing whiskey with Gramps out of an emptied jelly jar. As the night wore on, the two of them would solicit my help in composing dirty limericks. Eventually, the conversation would turn to laments about women. “They’ll drive you to drink, boy,” Frank would tell me soberly. “And if you let ’em, they’ll drive you into your grave.”

>I was intrigued by old Frank, with his books and whiskey breath and the hint of hard-earned knowledge behind the hooded eyes. The visits to his house always left me feeling vaguely uncomfortable, though, as if I were witnessing some complicated, unspoken transaction between the two men, a transaction I couldn’t fully understand.


&nbsp;


http://en.bookfi.net/book/1187382
>...“Yeah, I know-but it’s probably a little scary for her, seeing some big man block her way. It’s really no big deal.” He turned around and I saw now that he was shaking. “It is a big deal. It’s a big deal to me. She’s been bothered by men before. You know why she’s so scared this time? I’ll tell you why. Before you came in, she told me the fella was black.” He whispered the word. “That’s the real reason why she’s bothered. And I just don’t think that’s right.”

>The words were like a fist in my stomach, and I wobbled to regain my composure. In my steadiest voice, I told him that such an attitude bothered me, too, but assured him that Toot’s fears would pass and that we should give her a ride in the meantime. Gramps slumped into a chair in the living room and said he was sorry he had told me. Before my eyes, he grew small and old and very sad. I put my hand on his shoulder and told him that it was all right, I understood.

>...That night, I drove into Waikiki, past the bright-lit hotels and down toward the Ala-Wai Canal. It took me a while to recognize the house, with its wobbly porch and low-pitched roof. Inside, the light was on, and I could see Frank sitting in his overstuffed chair, a book of poetry in his lap, his reading glasses slipping down his nose. I sat in the car, watching him for a time, then finally got out and tapped on the door. The old man barely looked up as he rose to undo the latch.
>
>...I told Frank some of what had happened. He nodded and poured us each a shot. “Funny cat, your grandfather,” he said. “You know we grew up maybe fifty miles apart?” I shook my head. “We sure did. Both of us lived near Wichita. We didn’t know each other, of course. I was long gone by the time he was old enough to remember anything. I might have seen some of his people, though. Might’ve passed ’em on the street. If I did, I would’ve had to step off the sidewalk to give ’em room. Your grandpa ever tell you about things like that?”
>
>I threw the whiskey down my throat, shaking my head again.
>
>“Naw,” Frank said, “I don’t suppose he would have. ...You can’t blame Stan for what he is,” Frank said quietly. “He’s basically a good man. But he doesn’t know me. Any more than he knew that girl that looked after your mother. He can’t know me, not the way I know him. Maybe some of these Hawaiians can, or the Indians on the reservation. They’ve seen their fathers humiliated. Their mothers desecrated. But your grandfather will never know what that feels like. That’s why he can come over here and drink my whiskey and fall asleep in that chair you’re sitting in right now. Sleep like a baby. See, that’s something I can never do in his house. Never. Doesn’t matter how tired I get, I still have to watch myself. I have to be vigilant, for my own survival.”
>
>Frank opened his eyes. “What I’m trying to tell you is, your grandma’s right to be scared. She’s at least as right as Stanley is. She understands that black people have a reason to hate. That’s just how it is. For your sake, I wish it were otherwise. But it’s not. So you might as well get used to it.”
>
>Frank closed his eyes again. His breathing slowed until he seemed to be asleep. I thought about waking him, then decided against it and walked back to the car. The earth shook under my feet, ready to crack open at any moment. I stopped, trying to steady myself, and knew for the first time that I was utterly alone.


&nbsp;


http://en.bookfi.net/book/1187382
>...Even Frank thought I had a bad attitude, although he was less than clear about how I should change it.

>What had Frank called college? An advanced degree in compromise. I thought back to the last time I had seen the old poet, a few days before I left Hawaii. We had made small talk for a while; he complained about his feet, the corns and bone spurs that he insisted were a direct result of trying to force African feet into European shoes. Finally he had asked me what it was that I expected to get out of college. I told him I didn’t know. He shook his big, hoary head. “Well,” he said, “that’s the problem, isn’t it? You don’t know. You’re just like the rest of these young cats out here. All you know is that college is the next thing you’re supposed to do. And the people who are old enough to know better, who fought all those years for your right to go to college-they’re just so happy to see you in there that they won’t tell you the truth. The real price of admission.”

>“And what’s that?”

>“Leaving your race at the door,” he said. “Leaving your people behind.” He studied me over the top of his reading glasses. “Understand something, boy. You’re not going to college to get educated. You’re going there to get trained. They’ll train you to want what you don’t need. They’ll train you to manipulate words so they don’t mean anything anymore. They’ll train you to forget what it is that you already know. They’ll train you so good, you’ll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the American way and all that shit. They’ll give you a corner office and invite you to fancy dinners, and tell you you’re a credit to your race. Until you want to actually start running things, and then they’ll yank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well-trained, well-paid nigger, but you’re a nigger just the same.”

>“So what is it you’re telling me-that I shouldn’t be going to college?”

>Frank’s shoulders slumped, and he fell back in his chair with a sigh. “No. I didn’t say that. You’ve got to go. I’m just telling you to keep your eyes open. Stay awake.”

>It made me smile, thinking back on Frank and his old Black Power, dashiki self. In some ways he was as incurable as my mother, as certain in his faith, living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created. Keep your eyes open, he had warned. It wasn’t as easy as it sounded.

>...Anyway, most of the other black students at Oxy didn’t seem all that worried about compromise.

>...So why couldn’t I let it go?

>I don’t know. I didn’t have the luxury, I suppose, the certainty of the tribe. Grow up in Compton and survival becomes a revolutionary act. You get to college and your family is still back there rooting for you. They’re happy to see you escape; there’s no question of betrayal.

>...I can construct a certain logic to my decision, show how becoming an organizer was a part of that larger narrative, starting with my father and his father before him, my mother and her parents, my memories of Indonesia with its beggars and farmers and the loss of Lolo to power, on through Ray and Frank, Marcus and Regina; my move to New York; my father’s death. I can see that my choices were never truly mine alone-and that that is how it should be

>...And as I drove, I remembered. I remembered the whistle of the Illinois Central, bearing the weight of the thousands who had come up from the South so many years before; the black men and women and children, dirty from the soot of the railcars, clutching their makeshift luggage, all making their way to Canaan Land. I imagined Frank in a baggy suit and wide lapels, standing in front of the old Regal Theatre ...I made a chain between my life and the faces I saw, borrowing other people’s memories.

>...Anger at the leaders for being short-sighted. Anger at myself for believing I could have ever bridged the gap between them. I suddenly remembered what Frank had told me that night back in Hawaii, after I had heard that Toot was scared of a black man.

>That’s the way it is, he had said. You might as well get used to it.

>...It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela. And if later I saw that the black men I knew-Frank or Ray or Will or Rafiq-fell short of such lofty standards; if I had learned to respect these men for the struggles they went through, recognizing them as my own

>...The world was violent, I was learning, unpredictable and often cruel. My grandparents knew nothing about such a world, I decided; there was no point in disturbing them with questions they couldn’t answer. Sometimes, when my mother came home from work, I would tell her the things I had seen or heard, and she would stroke my forehead, listening intently, trying her best to explain what she could. I always appreciated the attention-her voice, the touch of her hand, defined all that was secure.

>...What tension I noticed had mainly to do with the gradual shift in my mother’s attitude toward me. She had always encouraged my rapid acculturation in Indonesia: It had made me relatively self-sufficient, undemanding on a tight budget, and extremely well mannered when compared to other American children. She had taught me to disdain the blend of ignorance and arrogance that too often characterized Americans abroad.

>Strong personalities shaped a future senator

>MERCER ISLAND, Wash. -- Chip Wall can't help but zero in on the little stuff whenever he watches Barack Obama on TV.

>The turn of the smile, the sharp wit, the comfortable self-assuredness, all of which he saw up close, a half-century ago.

>It's his old pal Stanley.

>For Wall and a few dozen others, Obama on the campaign trail often brings to mind Stanley Ann Dunham, Obama's mother and a strong-willed, unconventional member of the Mercer Island High School graduating class of 1960.

>...Her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham -- he was a boisterous, itinerant furniture salesman in downtown Seattle, she worked for a bank and was the quiet yet firm influence at home -- moved to Mercer Island in 1956, after one year in a Seattle apartment. The lure was the high school that had just opened and the opportunity it offered for their daughter

>...But consistent with the 1950s, there were undercurrents of turmoil. In 1955, the chairman of the Mercer Island school board, John Stenhouse, testified before the House Un-American Activities Subcommittee that he had been a member of the Communist Party.


http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CHINA/2000-01/0948080137
>John Stenhouse of Kirkland died Jan. 12, 2000, at the Care Center at Kelsey Creek. He was 91.

>Mr. Stenhouse was born Jan. 22, 1908, in Chungking, China. He graduated in 1926 from the Repton School in England. He had lived on the Eastside for 50 years.

>...Mr. Stenhouse was a member of the Washington State Democratic Party, the American Civil Liberties Union and North Rose Hill Neighborhood Association. He was past president of the Eastshore Unitarian Church and the Mercer Island School Board and was an organizer for the Group Health Cooperative. He enjoyed woodworking, gardening, watercolor and sketching. He was a political activist and very involved in the peace movement. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughters, Nicola Yarbrough of Bainbridge Island and Iona Stenhouse of Seattle


http://www.historylink.org/File/8897
>“People have asked me what was the incubus of her [Dunham’s] growth,” commented her friend and classmate Iona Stenhouse.  “I don’t think it was Mercer Island other than to form a contrarian view.  Civil rights and feminism just didn’t exist yet on Mercer Island in the late ‘50s. But we did have teachers who tried to expand our thinking, and this possibly became a foundation for Stanley’s growth.  She was very inquisitive and bright, and it doesn’t surprise me that she [later] reveled in living overseas” 


http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/obamas-mother-known-here-as-uncommon/
>For four years on Mercer Island, Stanley Ann Dunham impressed her high-school classmates with a wickedly sharp wit. She was an “intellectual rebel” with a fledgling beatnik sensibility that would eventually take her around the globe.

>...Stanley Ann Dunham’s classmates, many of whom had lived on the island their whole lives, viewed Dunham as a novelty.

>“She had a really ironic sense of humor, sort of downbeat and she was a great observer,” said Iona Stenhouse, of Seattle, a former classmate.

>...Dunham gravitated toward an intellectual clique. According to former classmate Chip Wall, she caught foreign films at Seattle’s only art-house theater, the Ridgemont, and trekked to University District coffee shops like the Encore to talk about jazz, the value of learning from other cultures and the “very dull Eisenhower-ness of our parents.”

>“We were critiquing America in those days in the same way we are today: The press is dumbed down, education is dumbed down, people don’t know anything about geography or the rest of the world,” said Wall, who later taught at Mercer Island High and is now retired in Seattle.

>...One respite was found in a wing of Mercer Island High called “anarchy alley.” Jim Wichterman taught a wide-open philosophy course that included Karl Marx.

>...Those classes prompted what Wichterman, now 80 and retired in Ellensburg, called “mothers’ marches” of parents outraged at the curriculum.

>Dunham thrived in the environment, Wichterman said.

>“As much as a high-school student can, she’d question anything: What’s so good about democracy? What’s so good about capitalism? What’s wrong with communism? What’s good about communism?” Wichterman said. “She had what I call an inquiring mind.”

>"I had them read 'The Communist Manifesto,' and the parents went nuts," said Wichterman, adding that parents also didn't want any discussions about "anything to do with sex," religion and theology. The parental protests were known as "mothers' marches."

>"The kids started questioning things that their folks thought shouldn't be questioned -- religion, politics, parental authority," said John Hunt, a classmate. "And a lot of parents didn't like that, and they tried to get them [Wichterman and Foubert] fired."

>The Dunhams did not join the uproar. Madelyn and Stanley shed their Methodist and Baptist upbringing and began attending Sunday services at the East Shore Unitarian Church in nearby Bellevue.

>"In the 1950s, this was sometimes known as 'the little Red church on the hill,' " said Peter Luton, the church's senior minister, referring to the effects of McCarthyism.

>While his mother was in Indonesia during part of his teenage years, Mr Obama lived with his white grandparents. Mrs Weatherly-Williams said that the poet was first introduced to the future Democratic presidential candidate in 1970 at the age of 10.

>“Stan had been promising to bring Barry by because we all had that in common - Frank’s kids were half-white, Stan’s grandson was half-black and my son was half-black. We all had that in common and we all really enjoyed it. We got a real kick out of reality.”

>That was only the first surprise. Stanley Ann began classes at the University of Hawaii in 1960, and shortly after that, Box received a letter saying that her friend had fallen in love with a grad student. He was black, from Kenya and named Obama.

>About that same time, another letter crossed the Pacific, this one heading to Africa. It was from Barack Obama Sr. to his mother, Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama. Though the letter didn't go into great detail, it said he had met a young woman named Ann (not Stanley). There wasn't much on how they met or what the attraction was, but he announced their plans to wed.


http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/obamas-mother-known-here-as-uncommon/
>...Dunham hadn’t had a boyfriend in high school, according to Maxine Box, her best friend at the time. So Box and others were stunned when Dunham wrote them to say she’d married the University of Hawaii’s first African student, a Kenyan named Barack Obama. She gave birth to Barack Obama Jr. in August 1961.

>“We could see Stanley, with her good grades and intelligence, going to college, but not marrying and having a baby right away,” said Box, a retired teacher in Bellevue.

>...While her girlfriends, including Box, regularly baby-sat, Stanley Ann showed no interest. "She felt she didn't need to date or marry or have children," Box recalled. "It wasn't a put-down, it wasn't hurtful. That's just who she was."


http://www.historylink.org/File/8897
>Added Maxine Box, Dunham’s best friend in high school: “When she was younger she was comfortable in the setting of Mercer Island, [but] I think when she moved to Hawaii it opened new worlds for her.  When she had the baby at 18, it must have been really hard, but I think once she realized she could handle it, she felt that she could handle anything”


http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/obamas-mother-known-here-as-uncommon/
>...The marriage was brief. By 1962, Dunham had returned to Seattle as a single mother, enrolling in the UW for spring quarter and living in an apartment on Capitol Hill. But friends said she got overwhelmed and returned to her family in Hawaii, and formally divorced Obama Sr. in 1964.

>Over the next three decades, she became a well-traveled anthropologist, working in Indonesia, Pakistan and elsewhere.

>“The life that Stanley chose to live after she left [Mercer Island] is indicative of the fact that Stanley thought about what else was out there,” said former classmate Stenhouse.

>“She was ready for having different experiences.”

>Years later, Abercrombie and another grad school friend looked up their old pal during a trip through Africa.

>At that point, the senior Obama was a bitter man, according to the congressman, feeling that he had been denied due opportunities to influence the running of his country. "He was drinking too much; his frustration was apparent," Abercrombie said.

The girl’s parents, wary at first, were won over by his charm and intellect; the young couple married, and she bore them a son, to whom he bequeathed his name. He won another scholarship-this time to pursue his Ph.D. at Harvard-but not the money to take his new family with him. A separation occurred, and he returned to Africa to fulfill his promise to the continent. The mother and child stayed behind, but the bond of love survived the distances….

>There the album would close, and I would wander off content, swaddled in a tale that placed me in the center of a vast and orderly universe. Even in the abridged version that my mother and grandparents offered, there were many things I didn’t understand. But I rarely asked for the details that might resolve the meaning of “Ph.D.” or “colonialism,” or locate Alego on a map. Instead, the path of my father’s life occupied the same terrain as a book my mother once bought for me, a book called Origins, a collection of creation tales from around the world, stories of Genesis and the tree where man was born, Prometheus and the gift of fire, the tortoise of Hindu legend that floated in space, supporting the weight of the world on its back. Later, when I became more familiar with the narrower path to happiness to be found in television and the movies, I’d become troubled by questions. What supported the tortoise? Why did an omnipotent God let a snake cause such grief? Why didn’t my father return? But at the age of five or six I was satisfied to leave these distant mysteries intact, each story self-contained and as true as the next, to be carried off into peaceful dreams.

>...To avoid being mistaken for a sellout, I chose my friends carefully. The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets. We smoked cigarettes and wore leather jackets. At night, in the dorms, we discussed neocolonialism, Franz Fanon, Eurocentrism, and patriarchy. When we ground out our cigarettes in the hallway carpet or set our stereos so loud that the walls began to shake, we were resisting bourgeois society’s stifling constraints. We weren’t indifferent or careless or insecure. We were alienated.

>...In six months I was broke, unemployed, eating soup from a can. In search of some inspiration, I went to hear Kwame Touré, formerly Stokely Carmichael of SNCC and Black Power fame, speak at Columbia. At the entrance to the auditorium, two women, one black, one Asian, were selling Marxist literature and arguing with each other about Trotsky’s place in history. Inside, Touré was proposing a program to establish economic ties between Africa and Harlem that would circumvent white capitalist imperialism. At the end of his remarks, a thin young woman with glasses asked if such a program was practical given the state of African economies and the immediate needs facing black Americans. Touré cut her off in midsentence. “It’s only the brainwashing that you’ve received that makes it impractical, sister,” he said. His eyes glowed inward as he spoke, the eyes of a madman or a saint. The woman remained standing for several minutes while she was upbraided for her bourgeois attitudes. People began to file out. Outside the auditorium, the two Marxists were now shouting at the top of their lungs.

>“Stalinist pig!”

>It was like a bad dream. I wandered down Broadway, imagining myself standing at the edge of the Lincoln Memorial and looking out over an empty pavilion, debris scattering in the wind. The movement had died years ago, shattered into a thousand fragments. Every path to change was well trodden, every strategy exhausted. And with each defeat, even those with the best of intentions could end up further and further removed from the struggles of those they purported to serve.

The vice-president, Odinga, was a Luo, and he said the government was becoming corrupt. That, instead of serving those who had fought for independence, Kenyan politicians had taken the place of the white colonials, buying up businesses and land that should be redistributed to the people. Odinga tried to start his own party, but was placed under house arrest as a Communist. Another popular Luo minister, Tom M’boya, was killed by a Kikuyu gunman. Luos began to protest in the streets, and the government police cracked down. People were killed.

After two months, the feuding politicians made an unlikely pact to share power. They signed an agreement under which Kibaki would remain president while Odinga took up a prime minister position. The wounds have not been as quick to heal; the following December, an editor at Nairobi's East African Standard said, "It will take decades, perhaps two or three generations, to sort out what happened last year."

>RAY SUAREZ: Who would be interested in committing a terrorist attack against a Russian-owned jet heading for a Russian city?

>MICHAEL WINES: Well, it’s an interesting question. I can think of two groups offhand. Russia has recently quite solidly joined the western side of this international coalition against terrorism, and it’s not a leap of speculation to think that someone might want to down a Russian plane to make a point to the Russians that they will pay a price, too, for siding with the United States. On the other hand, this is a plane that was filled almost exclusively with Jewish passengers, recent émigrés from Russia who had moved to Israel who were returning to Novosibirsk to celebrate a Jewish holiday. So it’s also equally easy to speculate, if it was in fact a terrorist act, that perhaps these were people who were downed as some sort of retaliation in the dispute between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

>After 9 Days, Ukraine Says Its Missile Hit A Russian Jet

>By MICHAEL WINES OCT. 14, 2001

>In strained language that acknowledged only a "tragic coincidence," Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, stated today that he accepted investigators' preliminary finding that his military accidentally destroyed a Russian airliner over the Black Sea last week with an errant missile.

>Mr. Kuchma's written statement, released tonight, did not explicitly state that the military was at fault. "Obviously, final results of the commission's inquiry will be known after experts complete their in-depth investigation and make appropriate assessments public," he said. "But even today it can be said that a big tragedy took place."

>Earlier today, Ukraine's military had taken responsibility after nine days of increasingly vaporous denials.

>...In an interview last week, an official at the St. Petersburg plant that manufactures long-range antiaircraft missiles said it was theoretically possible for the missile to "retarget" after missing its original target, if the new object has a sufficiently bright radar signal and is relatively slow moving.

>He added, however, that to his knowledge such retargeting had never occurred in tests.

>Both Ukrainian and Russian officials insisted for days after the crash that a Ukrainian missile could not possibly have been involved. Ukrainian military experts said a re-examination of data from the launchings for that day showed that all missiles had been accounted for and that none had flown more than 25 miles off the Crimean coast before plummeting into the sea.

>Mr. Kuchma called an accidental aircraft strike impossible. Mr. Tkachyov said all Ukrainian data showed that a missile could not have struck the plane. Relying on these assurances, Russia's defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, dismissed speculation about a missile strike as a "so-called" theory.

>But last week, as evidence to the contrary accumulated, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said publicly that Ukraine's proof was "insufficient," and Israel accused Kiev of being uncooperative in getting to the cause of the catastrophe.

>On Wednesday, Mr. Kuchma appeared to waver, adding that "bigger mistakes have been made," including in advanced European nations. That drew a withering response from a spokesman for Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who said that such remarks were easy to make when the 78 victims were from another nation.

>When Ukraine shot down Siberia Airlines Flight 1812  in 2001, how did Russians react to it? What actions were taken against Ukraine?

>Igor Markov

>Ukraine shot down SA 1812 during join military exercises with Russia in Crimea (this was the official conclusion of the investigators). Putin made an official statement that Ukraine could not shoot down the plane because it was beyond the range of the weapon that was fired. Ukraine made a similar statement. Both were wrong, but there was no better explanation available then. The matter was investigated, and eventually both sides agreed that a Ukrainian missile (i) was fired at a target that was hit by a different missile seconds earlier, (ii) failed to self-destruct, (iii) locked on a target well beyond its range and covered the distance to hit the target. The usual protocols were followed, and I believe money was paid to relatives of those who died. Ukraine fully cooperated with the investigation and, when the results were announced, acknowledged the guilt and imposed serious multiyear constraints on the use of the air-defense system involved in the accident. There is a conspiracy theory that Russia convinced the sitting Ukrainian president to acknowledge guilt for some serious, unannounced compensation paid to Ukraine.

>The situation was different then because there were no serious tensions between Russia and Ukraine. A more relevant case was Korean Air Lines Flight 007 shot down by the Soviet Union in 1983 because the plane strayed from its planned path. The pilot realized that this was a civilian plane, but was given an order to shoot it down. Soviet Union denied everything for years and impeded the investigation, giving credence to Ronald Reagan's phrase "the Empire of Evil". But when the evidence was officially examined, agreed to the only feasible version of events.

>Vladimir Dudintsev, 79, Dies; Writer Dissected Soviet Life

>By MICHAEL WINES JULY 30, 1998

>Vladimir D. Dudintsev, a reporter and novelist whose dissection of mid-1950's Soviet life drew the wrath of Nikita S. Khrushchev and the muffled praise of dissidents, died last Thursday at his dacha near here. He was 79 and had been ill since suffering a stroke several years ago.

>As the cold war was settling into a hard freeze in 1956, Mr. Dudintsev stirred political and literary sensations with the publication of "Not by Bread Alone," a 500-page novel that took indirect but unmistakable aim at the deadening effects of the Soviet system on the human spirit.

>...Mr. Dudintsev paid dearly. The book was quickly denounced as a "social evil." His writings became officially untouchable, and his family sank into poverty.

>By 1987, Mr. Dudintsev had fully regained favor, even publishing a second novel, "Robed in White," which won a state literary prize. But a friend and fellow journalist, Yury V. Danilin, stressed that any rehabilitation had occurred because Soviet leaders had changed their opinions. But not Mr. Dudintsev.

>"This was a really unique person in the history of our literature," said Mr. Danilin, deputy editor of the influential weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta. "He never gave up. He was continually claiming the truth."

>Mr. Dudintsev was not universally admired, especially among literary experts. His writing style, such as it was, was often called wooden and his plots were called convoluted.

>"No one ever said he was a great writer, a great artist," said Tatyana Tolstaya, a critic, writer and professor of creative writing who works in Russia and the United States. "In literature he was not a dissident. He just arranged his ideas in the form of a classic boring novel."

>..."Not by Bread Alone," which recounted the efforts of an inventor, Lopatkin, to convince his superiors to adopt his machine for the centrifugal casting of iron drain pipes. Lopatkin succeeded, but not before being oppressed, accused of divulging state secrets and spending time in an Arctic labor camp. Even in the end, Lopatkin's tormentors, all symbols of the overpowering Soviet bureaucracy, remain in power, with luxuries and freedoms that ordinary Russians could only dream about.

>...The Communist-controlled writers' union accused Mr. Dudintsev of "vilifying" Soviet society. Khrushchev wrote that Mr. Dudintsev "took a malicious joy in describing the negative sides of Soviet life," called the book "unhealthy, tendentious and noxious," and started a drive to force writers to hew more closely to Communist ideology.

>Mr. Dudintsev disappeared from view, except for a brief preface to a British edition of his book in which he wrote that foreigners had misinterpreted the novel. In 1960 he courted further punishment when Novy Mir published a parable, "A New Year's Tale," in which an evil and indolent bureaucracy tries to thwart a scientist's effort to bring light to a continent in darkness.

>...Although "Not by Bread Alone" secured Mr. Dudintsev's fame, his more courageous work may have been "Robed in White," another fictionalized account of how a Soviet scientist popular among Khrushchev's aides, Trofim D. Lysenko, all but destroyed Russian work in genetics and aided the persecution of other leading scientists.

>Mr. Dudintsev researched the book in the Khrushchev era, and it "is very hard to imagine what courage it took," Mr. Danilin said today.

>"Even studying this subject," he added, "was so dangerous it can be compared to working with a gun pointed at your head."
