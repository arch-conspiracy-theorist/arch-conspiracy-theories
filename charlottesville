	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (NEWSPLEX) -- The Charlottesville Police Department says the decision to move the Unite the Right rally to McIntire Park is about safety, but activist leader Jason Kessler is now suing the city because moving the rally will "dilute" his message.

	Trump has changed that. For antifa, the result has been explosive growth. According to NYC Antifa, the group’s Twitter following nearly quadrupled in the first three weeks of January alone. (By summer, it exceeded 15,000.) Trump’s rise has also bred a new sympathy for antifa among some on the mainstream left. “Suddenly,” noted the antifa-aligned journal It’s Going Down, “anarchists and antifa, who have been demonized and sidelined by the wider Left have been hearing from liberals and Leftists, ‘you’ve been right all along.’ ”

	...Those responses sometimes spill blood. Since antifa is heavily composed of anarchists, its activists place little faith in the state, which they consider complicit in fascism and racism. They prefer direct action: They pressure venues to deny white supremacists space to meet. They pressure employers to fire them and landlords to evict them. And when people they deem racists and fascists manage to assemble, antifa’s partisans try to break up their gatherings, including by force.

	Such tactics have elicited substantial support from the mainstream left. When the masked antifa activist was filmed assaulting Spencer on Inauguration Day, another piece in The Nation described his punch as an act of “kinetic beauty.”


a bit misleading--anyone would like to see Spencer punched, regardless of which political organization is doing the punching


	...A politicized fight culture is emerging, fueled by cheerleaders on both sides. As James Anderson, an editor at It’s Going Down, told Vice, “This shit is fun.”

	He is offering a glimpse into what Fox News would look like as an intellectually interesting network.

	In his vicious and ad hominem way, Carlson is doing something extraordinary: He’s challenging the Republican Party’s hawkish orthodoxy in ways anti-war progressives have been begging cable hosts to do for years. For more than a decade, liberals have rightly grumbled that hawks can go on television espousing new wars without being held to account for the last ones. Not on Carlson’s show.

	Scott continued, "Back in 2008, 2009, he was like pretty much anybody else in the family: He was a feminist, he was a progressive, he was a vegetarian. But around the time of Ron Paul's presidential campaign back in 2012, he started spending a lot of time on these sort of fringe Internet spaces like 4chan and getting all of his news from like, Infowars, and other places like that."

	It all happened "behind our backs," Scott said. The family didn't notice anything was going on until Tefft showed up to a family gathering "ranting about the Jews" and identifying himself as a fascist, the nephew said.

	Charlottesville Police Captain Victor Mitchell spoke to the press at City Hall Thursday, August 10. He said police are now anticipating 2,000 to 6,000 people in and around the Emancipation Park area on Saturday, August 12.

	White activist Jason Kessler plans to hold his Unite the Right rally in support of the statue to Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the park from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday.

	The split occurred over Spencer’s inclusion in the Lincoln Memorial “freedom of speech” rally, the latest in a series of such events across the country that have seen bloody clashes with anti-fascist “antifa” protesters. Those street battles gave rise to a series of alt-celebrities with considerable online audiences, including Jack Posobiec, Kyle “Based Stickman” Chapman, and Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet. Until now, they’ve largely stuck with each other post-election with antifa as their common enemy. But Posobiec and Chapman, originally billed to speak at the Lincoln Memorial, grew weary of being associated with white nationalist Spencer. They rebelled, forming their own competing rally a short walk away at the White House.


weird leaders, have "antifa" as their enemy

	...“I’m simply a man who wants to be able to say whatever the fuck he wants say,” said Tim Gionet, a former Buzzfeed writer turned alt-right personality, better known by his alias “Baked Alaska.”

	Hours after the incident occurred, Kessler chimed in and denounced the act, adding that the suspect “did the wrong thing” and that he was “saddened” that so many people were hurt.


why couldn't Trump do that?

	Kessler told NBC 29 in Charlottesville that the blame for the widespread violence is due to the government and police “failing to maintain law and order.”


Kessler blames police for violence.

	“The blame for today’s violence is primarily the result of the Charlottesville government officials and the law enforcement officers which failed to maintain law and order by protecting the First Amendment rights of the participants of the ‘Unite the Right’ rally,” he wrote in a statement. “We networked with law enforcement officials and safety arrangements were made months ago, but despite this, the Charlottesville Police Department not only failed to act per the plan but exacerbated the violence: they did not separate the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators, they were poorly underequipped for the situation, they stood idly by when violent counter-protesters attacked the participants of the rally and then they forced our demonstrators out of Lee Park and into a melee with Antifa.”


excpet Kessler ignored police warnings that it would be safer in a different park, threatened to sue


	...Screams of “murderer” and “shame” drowned out Kessler’s words at the brief press conference, and he was forced to run out of the area with authorities.

	“Her name was Heather, Jason,” a man chasing Kessler said in reference to the woman, Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car ran her down while she was at a counter protest one day earlier. “Her blood is on your hands, her blood is on your hood.”

	How is the Alt-Right ruining conservatism? The only thing conservatism ever conserved was things like tax cuts, multinational free-trade agreements and its own fundraising prowess.


anti-establishment

	White Genocide is the idea that the West has a hostile elite which is systematically replacing people of European ancestry in their own homelands. The Merkel government in Germany is a prime example of this. The same phenomenon can be found in every Western country.


"whites under attack"

	...Americans have a long history of restricting miscegenation for the sake of preserving our racial character as an outpost of European civilization. Here in the American South, we had such laws for three centuries. It used to be mainstream to want to remain a European society. Now, homosexuality, gay marriage and abortion are mainstream, and it is considered “fringe” to identify with our ancestors.


against race mixing, wants to preserve "whiteness"

	Seriously, we reject the ideal of expressive individualism which has had a devastating impact on the traditional family. We are nationalists, not liberals.


openly nationalist?

	...100 years of intelligence testing has shown nothing but enduring racial gaps in intelligence and academic achievement. The weight of the evidence is on our side. It is racial equality which is illusive. We have spent more trying to achieve racial equality in public education in the United States than any other civilization in the history of the world has invested in a monumental project.


"race realist"

	...In a sense, I will grant that we are similar to Black Lives Matter in that we are motivated by what we perceive to be our interests. Humans are social beings. It is natural to have a tribal identity. We are born into families and socialized into traditions as infants and children. Language is the most obvious example. Liberalism is based on the false premise that we are first and foremost individuals.

	...Pretty much all of human history is the story of conflict between rival groups with different identities. Our beliefs aren’t at odds with reality. Conservatives, however, prefer to engage in make believe. They give lip service to platitudes like “race doesn’t matter.” And yet, they don’t even really believe this. They know as well as we do that ethnic identity, culture, and racial demographics determine politics which is why they are so desperate to promote racial tokens.


inflate importance of race in ones identity


	Blacks have been present here for four centuries. We are still incapable of integrating them. Perhaps we think it is unwise to compound our racial problems?


thinks people of different races can never get along, disdain for black people

	We do believe in restricting immigration on the basis of ancestry and culture. The Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia illustrate that race is a far more powerful determinant of social outcomes than culture and ideas. If the French or English language and constitutional democracy was more important than ancestry and culture, the Democratic of Congo and Liberia would be thriving today. Francophone and Anglophone Africa are far more alike than either are to Britain and France.

	All other metrics aside, the Alt-Right march on Charlottesville was a success in one critical way.  White men, in the largest number to date, took to the streets and got active in meatspace.


basement dwelling nerds? /pol/tards?

	Whether the number was 500 or 5000 or somewhere in between, we can chalk this up as the largest public gathering of racially-conscious Whites in America in decades.


altright.com saying all the rally goers were racist like them

	...It’s the key to breaking out of victimhood and reaching your potential as a man. The next time you’re feeling black-pilled, put on your fashy T-Shirt and hit the streets.  Take a break from the internet and grow your Alt-Right network IRL.


creepy

playing to victimhood complex, trying to spread

	...Now that’s not saying everything went perfectly or even smoothly at this event.  We could have had better organization, better discipline, better planning, and better funding and support. If people only knew how young our organizers are, how volunteer-based this all is, how little money we have to work with and how much success we have been having despite all these factors, they would be shocked. Something as grassroots and powerful as our movement has never before been seen in history.


paid protestors?

	...But regardless of all that, every man who participated in the Charlottesville rally can look in the mirror and feel good about himself.  He can walk with a straighter back.  He can love his people from a deeper place in his soul.  And if anxiety and fear ever do start to creep in, he can recall the countless brothers who stood with him to face down the threat of anti-White scum throwing fists, rocks, and tear gas and think, “I am not alone. I went through the gauntlet and overcame the odds. Together, we got this.”

	Spencer and Dickson talked about the need to commemorate the dead whom they describe as dying in “brother wars” (i.e. wars between people of European ancestry). In response the crowd chanted “no more brother wars.”

	It started Friday afternoon when a group of about 150 clad in white polos and white dresses formed a marching column called a “white bloc” — a response to the “black bloc” uniforms of anarcho-communist group Antifa — at MacGuffey Art Center and marched in military formation to Jackson Park where they turned about face to greet featured speakers Richard Spencer, Sam Dickson, Nathan Damigo and Mike Peinovich.

	Spencer spoke first, saying, “We are here to say no; no more attacks on our heritage, on our identity; no more attacks on us as a people.”

    Millenials are arising in a period when no one at that dinner table are connected to the second world war. That might seem meaningless but it is absolutely profound and meaningful. It means that they are able to get out from under this massive black cloud, this massive anvil of guilt that has been weighing down our people. This great black cloud that hangs over us called Hitler or Auschwitz or the Holocaust or what have you. We don't need to question the accuracy of the history. Because at the end of the day, facts don't matter.

railing against "white guilt," implying its some kind of opperssion to be taken seriously


Here's Domigo, Spencer and Duke's speeches from the same event.

    This is more than just a Confederate monument. This is images of white people. This is images of white heroes, images of white warriors, that are being torn down to attack and demoralize our people. Make us think that we don't have a future. They don't want us to have a future. They want to destroy our future. They want to replace us with some sort of mixed muddy people that would just be easy consumers that won't stand up for themselves.

	Although members of the “alt-right” insist they're not racist, from a practical standpoint it's been tricky, if not impossible, to find any daylight between the views they espouse and plain old white supremacy. And now, a new working paper from researchers at the University of Arkansas and Northwestern University sharply underscores the extent to which people who identify as “alt-right” harbor prejudicial views toward non-white people.

	Alt - right adherents were much more  distrustful of the mainstream media and government; express ed higher Dark Triad  t raits, social dominance orientation, and authoritarianism; report ed high levels of  aggression ; and exhibit ed extreme levels of overt intergroup bias , including  blatant dehumanization of racial minorities. Cluster analyses suggest that a lt - right supporters may separate i nto  two subgroups: one  more  populist and anti - establishment and the other more supremacist  and motivated by maintaining  social hierarchy .  We  argue  for the need to give  overt  bias  greater empirical and theoretical  consideration in contemporary intergroup  research


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/16/the-alt-right-is-just-another-word-for-white-supremacy-study-finds/
	In the paper, “A Psychological Profile of the Alt-Right,” Patrick Forscher and Nour Kteily attempt to asses the beliefs of the “alt-right” using an extensive online survey. It was conducted via Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, which social science researchers have increasingly used in recent years to explore otherwise difficult-to-answer research questions. They recruited 447 “alt-right” adherents and 382 non-adherents and asked them a battery of questions on topics ranging from race to economics to the proper role of government.
