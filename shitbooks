	The Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner: From the Turn of the Century to His Death
	By Guenther Wachsmuth

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guenther_Wachsmuth
	Guenther Wachsmuth (4 October 1893, Dresden â€” 2 March 1963, Dornach, Switzerland) was a jurist, economist, anthroposophist, author and first Secretary and Treasurer of the Anthroposophical Society.
